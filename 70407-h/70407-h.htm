  <figcaption class="caption">SURFMAN WALKER, ORLEANS STATION, DRESSED
FOR STORMY NIGHT ON THE BEACH.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Cape Cod’s life savers are
known the world over for
their intrepid, enduring bravery,
gallant deeds, and the
success in rescuing life that
they have achieved in their
hazardous duties along the
most dangerous winter coast
of the world.</p>

<p>Every night, along the
shores of Cape Cod, from
Wood End at Provincetown
to Monomoy at Chatham, in
moonlight, starlight, thick
darkness, driving tempest,
wind, rain, snow or hail, an
endless line of life savers
steadily march along the exposed
beaches on the outlook
for endangered vessels.</p>

<p>The life saver’s work is
always arduous, often terrible.
Quicksands, the blinding
snow and cutting sand
storms, the fearful blasts of winter gales, are more often than not to
be encountered on their journeys; storm tides, flooding the beaches,
drive them to the tops or back of the sand dunes, where they plod
along their solitary patrol with great peril.</p>

<p>When a ship is in distress, whatever way the crew is rescued by the
life savers, the task involves great hazard of their lives, hours of racking
labor, protracted exposure to the roughest weather conditions, and
a mental and bodily strain under the spur of exigency and the curb of
discipline that exhaust even these hardy fearless coast guardians. In
cases of boat service tremendous additional peril and hardships are
added.</p>

<p>Death has often claimed the life saver at his work. Or as a result
of his gallant, unselfish toil for the safety of others in the rigors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
winter, one life saver after another is compelled to retire from the
service on account of shattered health.</p>

<figure id="i006" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35em;">

</figcaption></figure>

<p>Beyond their wages of sixty-five dollars per month the surfmen
receive no allowances or emoluments of any kind except the quarters
and fuel provided at the stations.</p>

<p>No person belonging to the service is allowed to hold an interest
in or to be connected with any wrecking company, nor is he entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
to salvage upon any property he may save or assist to save. A surfman
cannot be discharged from the service without good and sufficient
reason. For well proven neglect of patrol duty or for disobedience or
insubordination at a wreck the keeper may instantly discharge him;
in all other cases special authority must be first obtained from the
general superintendent.</p>

<p>The keeper lives at his station throughout the year, thus being on
hand during the two summer months to summon the crew and volunteers
in case of shipwreck or accident.</p>

<p>In “The Life Savers of Cape Cod” it has been the aim of the
author to pen-picture some of the heroic deeds performed by these
guardians of the “ocean graveyard,” as the shores of Cape Cod are
known, the terrible hardships they are called upon to endure, and the
peril they constantly face in the work of saving life and property, together
with illustrations of the life-saving stations on Cape Cod, the
boats, beach apparatus, breeches-buoy, etc., used in saving lives,
photographs of the crews of the different stations, a historical sketch
of the life-saving service, and stories of historic disasters, with biographies
of the life savers of Cape Cod, their duties, manner of living,
and their achievements.</p>

<p>Cape Cod extends directly out into the Atlantic, like a gigantic arm
with clutched hand, bidding defiance to the mighty ocean, for a distance
of forty miles. Shifting sand bars parallel its eastern shores, which are
an unbroken line of sandy beaches from Monomoy Point at Chatham
to Wood End at Provincetown, a distance of about fifty miles.
Myriads of shoals lie along the coast, and unnumbered vessels have
met their doom along its shores, which rightly bear the name “Ocean
Graveyard.”</p>

<p>The shores of Cape Cod from Monomoy to Wood End are literally
strewn with the bones of once staunch crafts, while unmarked graves
in the burial-places in the villages along the coast mutely relate the
sad tale of the sacrifice of human life.</p>

<p>Scenes of awful terror and heroic rescues have taken place at the
time of shipwreck along these shifting sand bars, and here, too, the
life savers have given up their lives in devotion to their duty.</p>

<h3>HISTORIC WRECKS.</h3>

<p>Thousands of lives have been lost in the wrecks that have taken
place along the shores of Cape Cod since the <i>Mayflower</i> cast anchor in
the harbor at Provincetown in 1620. There is no record of the disasters
previous to the establishment of the United States Life-Saving
Service in 1872, other than mention in town records and histories of
the dates and circumstances of the most memorable, or those attended
by great loss of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>The first shipwreck on Cape Cod, of which there is any record,
occurred in 1626, when the historic ship <i>Sparrowhawk</i>, Captain Johnson,
from England, with colonists bound for Virginia, stranded on
the shoals near Orleans, and became a total loss. The story of the
wreck is told by Governor Bradford in his diary of the Plymouth
Colony. The ship’s bones were discovered in a mud bank in 1863,
the washing away of the shore line disclosing them to view.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>Another historic wreck was that of the British frigate <i>Somerset</i>,
which stranded on Peaked Hill Bars, Nov. 2 or 3, 1778. The <i>Somerset</i>
was one of the fleet of British men-of-war, whose guns had
stormed the heights of Bunker Hill, and terrorized the commerce of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the colonies. She was at anchor in Boston Harbor the night that
Paul Revere made his famous ride. When she met with disaster she
was in pursuit of a fleet of French ships, which were reported to be in
Boston Harbor. The <i>Somerset</i> had been at anchor in Provincetown
harbor for some time, leaving there a few days before she was lost,
to go in search of the French ships. She struck Peaked Hill Bars
during a northeast gale, while trying to round the Cape, and enter
the harbor at Provincetown. She had a complement of four hundred
and eighty men, and is supposed to have carried sixty guns, thirty-two,
twenty-four, and twelve pounders. She struck on the bars with
terrific force, and instantly the seas began to pound her to pieces.
She was finally thrown up on the beach by the tumultuous walls of
water, and Captain Aurey and the few of the crew who had not
perished reached the shore.</p>

<figure id="i009" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i009.jpg" width="1438" height="954" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">MATILDA BUCK.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The residents of Provincetown viewed the wreck from High Pole
Hill, and summoned Capt. Enoch Hallett, of Yarmouth, and Colonel
Doane, of Wellfleet, who, with a detachment of militia, made Captain
Aurey and the survivors prisoners.</p>

<p>Captain Hallett took charge of the prisoners, marching them up the
Cape to Barnstable, and later to Boston, Colonel Doane being left to
look after the wrecked craft. There was much jubilation on Cape
Cod and in Boston over the disaster. The bones of the <i>Somerset</i>
remained buried for a century, when the shifting sands exposed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
to view. Relic hunters soon carried away nearly all of the wreckage
that could be obtained, and the shifting sands have again entombed
what remains of the famous old frigate.</p>

<p>Another historic wreck was that of the pirate ship <i>Widdah</i>, which
was lost near the site of the Cahoon’s Hollow Life-Saving Station in
1718. The ship was commanded by Captain Bellamy, and carried
twenty-three guns and a crew of one hundred and thirty men. Captain
Bellamy had captured seven vessels off the shores of Cape Cod,
and on one of them had placed seven of his crew. The captain of the
captured ship ran his vessel close to the shore, and the seven pirates
were taken prisoners. Later six of them were executed in Boston.
The <i>Widdah</i> soon after was driven ashore during a gale, and all hands,
save an Englishman and an Indian, were lost.</p>

<figure id="i010" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i010.jpg" width="1410" height="941" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">A BAD WRECK.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>A scene of awful terror occurred when the <i>Josephus</i>, a British ship,
was wrecked on Peaked Hill Bars in the year 1842. She had a cargo
of iron rails. Her crew had been driven to the rigging as soon as the
vessel struck, and one after another they were seen to fall into the
raging sea. Those who had gathered on the shore could hear the despairing
cries of the imperiled crew, but were powerless to aid them.
At last two of the spectators, Daniel Cassidy and Jonathan Collins,
procured a dory, and against the earnest pleadings of their friends,
and in the almost certain assurance that they were going to their
death, pushed off from the beach, saying as a last farewell, “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
can’t stand this any longer; we are going to try and rescue those
poor fellows if it cost us our lives.” Half-way out to the wreck the
two heroes successfully battled with the sea, then a giant comber,
catching their frail boat, carried it along and buried it under tons of
tumbling water. The gallant men were seen to rise and struggle
desperately to reach the overturned boat, but perished in the attempt.
The men remaining in the rigging of the <i>Josephus</i> were soon after
swept to death by the monstrous waves that tore the ship to pieces.</p>

<p>In 1848 the brig <i>Cactus</i> was lost on the bars along the back of the
Cape.</p>

<figure id="i011" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">WRECKERS AT WORK ON KATIE J. BARRETT.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Along the shore near the Cahoon’s Hollow Station the immigrant
ship <i>Franklin</i> was deliberately run ashore in 1849, and many of her
poor, helpless passengers perished in the disaster. This was one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the most appalling disasters that ever occurred on Cape Cod. Speedy
retribution came to the officers of the ship for their terrible crime,
the captain and nearly all the others losing their own lives in the
wreck. The late Capt. Benjamin S. Rich, afterwards of the United
States Life-Saving Service, was the first to discover the wreck, and
also found a box containing some papers that subsequently proved
that the disaster was intentional.</p>

<p>The year 1853 was a memorable one in the history of Cape Cod,
there being twenty-three appalling disasters along its shore during
that period. Among the vessels lost were many ships and brigs well
known in shipping circles in Boston and on Cape Cod. The weather
was bitter cold and violent storms swept the coast when most of the
vessels were lost, so that nothing could be done to assist the imperiled
crews, and those who did reach the shore perished from exposure on
the desolate uplands and beaches.</p>

<p>In 1866 the <i>White Squall</i>, built for a blockade runner, while on her
way home from China, struck on the bars along the back of the Cape
and became a total loss.</p>

<p>The wreck of the <i>Aurora</i> is known to Cape Codders as the “Palm
Oil Wreck.” The vessel was loaded with palm oil from the west coast
of Africa. She struck on the bars off the back of the Cape, and was a
total loss.</p>

<p>Another terrible disaster was the wreck of the schooner <i>Clara Belle</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
coal laden, which stranded on the bars off High Head Station, on the
night of March 6, 1872, at the height of a fearful blizzard. Captain
Amesbury and crew of six men attempted to reach the shore in their
boat. The craft had gone but a few yards when she was overturned,
throwing the men into the sea. John Silva was the only member of
the crew that reached the shore. He found himself alone on a frozen
beach with the mercury below zero. He wandered about during the
night trying to find some place of shelter, and was found the next
morning by a farmer standing dazed, barefooted, and helpless in the
highway three miles from the scene of the wreck. His feet and hands
were frozen, and it was a long time before he recovered from the
effects. The schooner was driven high and dry on the beach, and
when boarded the next day a warm fire was found in the cabin. The
haste of the crew to leave the vessel had cost them their lives.</p>

<figure id="i013" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">

<p>The first fearful disaster after the life-saving service reorganization,
took place on Peaked Hill Bars, March 4, 1875, when the Italian
bark <i>Giovanni</i> became a total loss and her crew of fourteen perished.
The bark stranded too far from the beach to be reached by the wreck
ordnance used in those days, and the surf was pounding on the shore
with such fury that a boat could not be launched, much less live, in
the sea. No assistance could be rendered the poor sailors, and one by
one they dropped into the sea and were lost.</p>

<p>The most appalling disaster in the history of the life-saving service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
on Cape Cod was the wreck of the iron ship <i>Jason</i>, on the bars at
Pamet River, Dec. 5, 1893. Twenty-four lives were lost. The ship
was bound from Calcutta, India, for Boston, with a cargo of jute.
Captain McMillan, who was in charge of the ship, had a crew of
twenty-four men, including an apprentice, Samuel J. Evans, of Raglan,
England. Thick weather prevailed off the coast for several days
preceding the disaster, and Captain McMillan, not being in possession
of reliable information as to his position, obtained it from a New York
pilot boat.</p>

<p>When about one hundred miles off the coast he unfortunately
shaped his course to the westward for the purpose of raising some
landmark. When the <i>Jason</i> approached the Cape, the wind was
blowing a gale from the northeast, and the atmosphere was thick with
rain, which soon turned to sleet and snow.</p>

  <img src="images/i014.jpg" width="1469" height="886" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">AT THE MERCY OF THE SEA.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The life savers along the shore at Nauset first saw the <i>Jason</i>, and
word that a ship was in dangerous proximity to the shore was sent
along the Cape to all the stations. The <i>Jason</i> was last seen just
before five o’clock by the day patrol of the Nauset Station. The life
savers, knowing that she could hardly weather the Cape, kept a sharp
lookout for her, and at all the stations the horses were hitched into
the beach carts and every preparation made to go to the assistance of
the ship without a moment’s delay. It was a fearful night along the
shores of Cape Cod, the coast guardians having all they could do to
go over their patrol. Nothing was seen or heard of the doomed ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
up to seven o’clock in the evening, and the life savers hoped that she
had managed to work offshore or around the Cape. At half-past
seven, however, Surfman Honey, of the Pamet River Station, burst
into the station, and shouted, “Hopkins (the north patrol) has just
burned his signal.” A moment later Hopkins rushed into the station
and reported that the <i>Jason</i> had struck on the bars about a half mile
north of the station. Keeper Rich and his crew were ready for the
emergency, and, with the beach cart, rushed to the scene. The shore
was then piled with wreckage, and the slatting of the sails of the
wrecked ship sounded above the roar and din of the storm. A careful
lookout for the shipwrecked seafarers was kept by the life savers as
they hurried to the scene, and Evans, the sole survivor of the disaster,
was found clinging to a bale of jute. He was clad only in his
underclothes, and was almost totally helpless.</p>

<p>The wrecked vessel was sighted through the storm and a shot
promptly fired over the craft, but the crew had perished almost as
soon as the ship struck, and the efforts of the life savers were of no
avail. The ship (it was afterwards learned from young Evans) broke
in two almost as soon as she struck, and the members of the crew
perished shortly after. Evans told the author that as soon as the ship
struck he put on a life-preserver and took to the rigging. The
captain ordered the boats launched, but they were smashed as soon as
they struck the water. While clinging to the rigging, considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
what was best to do, Evans says that he must have been hit by a big
wave or wall of water, as the next that he knew he was on the beach
and the life savers were taking him to the station. The bodies of
twenty of the crew were found and buried in the cemetery at Wellfleet.
Evans soon recovered from the effects of the buffeting he
received by the seas, and returned to his home in England. Part of
the ship is now visible at low tide, and is an object of much interest to
visitors to Cape Cod.</p>

<p>The wreck of the ship <i>Asia</i>, in which twenty lives were lost, occurred
on Nantucket shoals, near the Great Round Shoal Lightship in February,
1898. The ship was on her way from Manila for Boston, and was
commanded by Captain Dakin. Besides the crew of twenty-three men
Captain Dakin’s wife and little daughter were aboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>The ship struck on the shoals during a furious northeast gale and
snowstorm on Sunday afternoon, but did not begin to break up until
the next day.</p>

<p>When the ship commenced to pound to pieces, the mate and the few
members of the crew who had not been swept overboard did all in
their power to assist Captain Dakin in shielding his wife and daughter
from being swept away by the seas which were breaking over the
craft. Before the ship broke up, the mate lashed the captain’s daughter
and himself to a big piece of wreckage, hoping in that way to reach
the shore. Captain Dakin and his wife were swept to death before
they could fasten themselves to any of the wreckage. Of the whole
number aboard the ill-fated craft but three were saved. These were
sailors, who clung to a piece of the ship, and after drifting about in
Vineyard Sound for several days, were picked up nearly dead and
placed aboard one of the lightships. The bodies of the mate, with
his arms locked about the captain’s daughter, and both securely lashed
to a piece of wreckage, were picked up a few days later in Vineyard
Sound. Both had been frozen to death. But few of the bodies of the
other members of the crew were found. The ship became a total loss,
and the following day there was not a vestige of her left to mark the
spot where the tragedy took place.</p>

<p>The schooner <i>Job H. Jackson</i> was another terrible wreck that occurred
on Peaked Hill Bars. The schooner struck on Jan. 5, 1895,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
during bitter cold weather, and the crew were driven into the rigging.
A fearful sea was pounding on the shore, and it required the combined
herculean efforts of the Peaked Hill Bars, Race Point, and High Head
life-saving crews, with their life-boats, to rescue the imperiled seafarers,
who were badly frost-bitten and helpless when taken from the
wrecked vessel.</p>

<p>The schooner <i>Daniel B. Fearing</i>, which became a total loss on the
bars off Cahoon’s Hollow Station, struck there during a fog on May 6,
1896. The life savers put off to the wreck in their surf-boat, and
brought the crew ashore. A gale sprung up with great suddenness
as the crew were leaving the doomed vessel, and as the last man
jumped into the life-boat the masts of the big schooner fell with a
crash, and the sea soon completed the work of total destruction.</p>

<p>On Sept. 14, 1896, the Italian bark <i>Monte Tabor</i> struck on Peaked
Hill Bars during a furious northeast gale. The disaster was attended
with the loss of five men, whose deaths were involved in circumstances
of mysterious and almost romantic interest. Three were suicides,
while the manner in which the other two perished could not be certainly
explained. The bark hailed from Genoa, and carried a crew of
twelve persons, including the officers and two boys. She had a cargo
of salt from Trapani, Island of Sicily, for Boston. The craft had been
struck by a hurricane on September 9, and when off Cape Cod on the
night of the 13th, in endeavoring to make the harbor at Provincetown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
she struck the dreaded Peaked Hill Bars. She was discovered by
Patrolman Silvey, of the Peaked Hill Bars Station. The night was
pitch dark, the surf extremely high, and the bark was soon pounded to
pieces. As the life-saving crews could not locate the wreck, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
nothing to shoot at and nothing to pull to, even if a boat could have
been launched. It is believed that the captain was so humiliated by
the loss of his vessel, that he fell into a frenzy of despair, and resolved
to take his own life, and it would appear that others of his crew followed
his example of self-destruction.</p>

<p>Six of the crew managed to reach the shore on the top of the cabin,
and were pulled out of the surf by the life savers. Another, a boy,
said that he swam ashore. An investigation, conducted by the Italian
counsel, disclosed that the captain committed suicide.</p>

<p>The first evidence that the steamer <i>Portland</i> had met with disaster
during the memorable gale of November, 1898, was found by John
Johnson, a surfman of the Race Point Station, who picked up a life-preserver
from the ill-fated craft.</p>

<p>Soon after Johnson found the life-preserver, wreckage from the
steamer was seen in the surf along the shore, and within a short time
the beach for miles was strewn with it. All the life savers suffered
great hardship during that gale, which was the worst in the history of
the life-saving service.</p>

<p>Twice since the establishment of the United States Life-Saving
Service on Cape Cod, the life savers in the life-boats have met with
disaster, and members of the crews perished in the catastrophe.</p>

<p>But the Monomoy disaster of March 17, 1902 was the most appalling

life savers, perishing.</p>

to the wrecked vessels, but it was a summons which the brave and

<p>The story of this disaster is still fresh in the public mind.</p>

<h3>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LIFE-SAVING SERVICE ON CAPE COD.</h3>

<p>The establishment of the United States Life-Saving Service on Cape
Cod dates back but thirty years, which time also marks the reorganization,
extension, and beginning of its efficiency in the United States.
While as early as 1797 the town of Truro sold to the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Government a tract of land upon which to erect the first lighthouse on
Cape Cod,—Highland Light, so called,—it was not until half a century
later that the government began to provide means for the relief of
mariners wrecked upon its coasts, and seventy-five years afterwards
that the first United States Life-Saving Station was erected on the
shores of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Humane Society, originally formed in 1786, and
incorporated for general purposes of benevolence a few years later,
was the first to attempt organized relief for shipwrecked seafarers in
the United States as well as upon Cape Cod.</p>

<figure id="i023" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i023.jpg" width="1486" height="944" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">ONE OF THE FIRST LIFE-SAVING CREWS.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Society first began its work of rendering assistance to shipwrecked
mariners by building huts on many of the desolate sections
of the coast. These huts were for the shelter of shipwrecked persons
who might reach the shore. The first building of this kind was
erected on Lovell’s Island in Boston Harbor in 1807. Later, the Society
established the first life-boat station at Cohasset, subsequently
erecting others along the coast, and extending its good work to the
shores of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>While the Society relied solely upon volunteer crews to man these
life-boats in times of disaster, its efforts in saving life and property
were of great value, and both the state and general government tendered
it pecuniary aid at various times. When the government extended
the life-saving service to Cape Cod, the Society was relieved of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
its burden of protecting that dangerous coast, thus enabling it to
better provide for other sections of the coast of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Humane Society may be considered the parent
of the United States Life-Saving Service. The Society is one of the
oldest in the world. It originated its coast service more than thirty-six
years before the English did, while the French service dates its
birth much later.</p>

<p>In 1845, a few years before Congress took steps for providing means
for rendering assistance to wrecked vessels along the coasts of the
United States, the Society had eighteen stations on the Massachusetts
coast, with boats and mortars for throwing life lines to stranded vessels,
in addition to numerous huts of refuge.</p>

<figure id="i024" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i024.jpg" width="1452" height="967" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">ETHEL MAUD BEING BURIED IN THE SAND.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>With the exception of the Life-Saving Benevolent Association of
New York, chartered by the Legislature of that State in 1849, no other
successful organized efforts outside of those of the government were
made up to this time to lessen the distress incident to shipwreck.</p>

<p>The first appropriation made by Congress for rendering assistance
to the shipwrecked from shore was March 3, 1847. For nearly a half
century prior to this time the efforts of the government for the protection
of mariners upon the coasts of the United States were mainly
in establishing the coast survey and extending the lighthouse system.</p>

<p>In 1848 the attention of Congress was called to the immediate needs
of providing further means for rendering assistance to wrecked vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
along the Atlantic coast, and a second appropriation of $10,000 was
made. The first appropriation of $5,000 remained in the treasury as
an unexpended balance.</p>

<p>Later, this money was placed in the hands of the Collector of
Customs at Boston for the benefit of the Massachusetts Humane
Society, for use in the work of building and equipping new life
stations along the Massachusetts coast.</p>

<p>The second appropriation of $10,000 was for expenditure upon the
New Jersey coast. With this appropriation eight boat-houses were
erected and supplied with appliances for saving life and property.
This marks the beginning of
the life-saving service of the
United States.</p>

<p>In 1849 Congress appropriated
$20,000 for life-saving
purposes. With this sum eight
life-saving stations were built
on the Long Island coast and
six additional stations erected
on the shores of New Jersey.
While these newly established
life-saving stations were not
manned by regular drilled
crews of surfmen, as at present,
they often proved of great
value at times of disaster, and in 1850 Congress made another appropriation
of $20,000 for life-saving purposes.</p>

<figure id="i025" class="figright" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img src="images/i025.jpg" width="1236" height="1031" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">ONE OF THE FIRST UNITED STATES LIFE-SAVING
STATIONS.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Of this sum half was expended in erecting additional stations along
the shores of Long Island, and for a new station at Watch Hill,
R.&#160;I.</p>

<p>The attention of Congress having been called to the needs of some
means of rendering assistance to wrecked vessels along the coasts of
North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Texas, the remaining
$10,000 of this appropriation was expended in placing life-boats
at the most exposed points on these coasts.</p>

<p>In 1853 and 1854 Congress made liberal appropriations for life-saving
purposes, and fourteen new stations were built on the coast of
New Jersey.</p>

<p>The service was at this time extended to the Great Lakes, twenty-three
life-boats being stationed at different points on Lake Michigan,
and several others on the other lake shores and on the Atlantic coast.
In 1854 there were one hundred and thirty-seven life-boats stationed
along the coasts of the United States. Of this number fifty-five were
at stations on the New York and New Jersey coasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption">AFTER THE BEACH COMBERS HAVE WORKED ON THE WRECK.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The absence of drilled and disciplined crews at these stations, however,—together
with irresponsible custodians and the lack of proper
equipments, the result of pillage or decay,—contributed to great loss
of life and heartrending scenes of disaster along the Atlantic coast.
The inefficiency of the life-saving service, as it then existed, was
apparent to all. Public sentiment had now become excited, and Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
was appealed to for immediate relief from the existing
conditions.</p>

<p>In 1853 a bill which provided for the increase and repair of the
stations and the guardianship of the life-boats passed the Senate;
but, unfortunately, failed to reach the House before adjournment.
An appalling disaster, the wreck of the <i>Powhatan</i>, on the coast of New
Jersey, in which three hundred lives were lost, caused the bill to be
promptly and favorably acted upon at the next session of Congress.
Under the provisions of this bill a superintendent at a salary of
$1,500 per annum was appointed for the Atlantic and Lake coasts,
keepers were placed in charge of the stations at a salary of $200,
bonded custodians secured for the life-boats and other apparatus, and
the stations and equipments speedily put in order.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">ELSIE M. SMITH, WHICH BECAME A TOTAL LOSS ON NAUSET BEACH.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The service was somewhat improved as a result of this, but there
were still many defects in it, which were brought to light as disaster
followed disaster along the seaboard. Up to this time the life-saving
crews were not regularly employed.</p>

<p>A bill providing for the employment of regular crews of surfmen
was presented to Congress in 1869. Strange though it may seem, in
view of the terrible disasters and loss of life which had so recently
taken place along the Atlantic coast, the bill suffered defeat. A substitute
bill, however, which provided for the employment of crews of
surfmen, though only at alternate stations, was passed. This marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the beginning of the employment of crews of surfmen at the United
States life-saving stations, and was the first step in the direction of
their employment at all stations for regular periods.</p>

<figure id="i028" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i028.jpg" width="1425" height="944" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">SHIP A.&#160;S. ROPES DISMASTED OFF PROVINCETOWN DURING A GALE.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>During the winter of 1870–71 a number of appalling, fatal disasters
occurred along the Atlantic coast. These disasters not only revealed
the fact that the coast was not properly guarded, but also that the
service was inefficient and needed a more complete organization. In
1871 Congress again appropriated $200,000 and authorized the Secretary
of the Treasury to employ crews of surfmen at such stations
and for such periods as he might deem necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner I. Kimball, the present general superintendent of the
United States Life-Saving Service, was at that time in charge of the
Revenue Marine Service, and the life-saving stations being then
under the charge of that bureau, he at once took steps to ascertain the
conditions of the service.</p>

<p>An officer of the Revenue Marine Service was at once detailed to
visit the life-saving stations and to make a report of their condition
and requirements.</p>

<p>The report made by the officer was a startling revelation. Absolutely
no discipline was found among the crews, no care had been
taken of the apparatus, some of the stations were in ruins, others
lacked such articles as powder, rockets, and shot lines, every portable
article had been stolen from many stations, and the money that Congress
had appropriated had been practically wasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>From the report it was plainly evident that the reorganization of
the service must be speedily brought about, and in accordance with
an act of Congress in 1872, the organization of the present system of
life-saving districts with superintendents took place.</p>

<p>The inefficient keepers were at once removed and the most skilled
boatmen obtainable were placed in charge of the stations.</p>

<p>The stations were also manned by the most expert surfmen to be
found along the coast, and the patrol of the coast at night and during
thick weather by day was inaugurated. It was soon found that the
life-saving stations, however, were too far apart for the crews to be of
assistance to one another in the event of a wreck, and measures were
adopted to place them within distances of from three to five miles of
one another. To bring about this result, twelve new stations were
built on the New Jersey coast, six on Long Island, while the location
of some of the existing stations were changed.</p>

<p>The stations were plain houses forty-two feet long and eighteen
wide, of two stories and four rooms. One room below was used by
the crew as mess-room, the other room contained the boats and other
apparatus used at wrecks. One of the upper rooms was used as a
sleeping room for the crew, the other room was used as a storeroom.</p>

<p>As a result of the reorganization of the service, the record for the
first season shows that not a life was lost in the disasters that occurred
on either the Lake shores or the Atlantic coast.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>Interest in the success of the life-saving service under the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
system was now keyed up to a high pitch. Congress had authorized
a new station for the coast of Rhode Island in 1871, and in June, 1872,
one more was ordered for that coast, and nine for the coast of Cape
Cod. These stations were built and manned in the winter of 1872.
The nine that were erected on Cape Cod were located as follows:
Race Point and Peaked Hill Bars, at Provincetown; Highlands, at
North Truro; Pamet River, at Truro; Cahoon’s Hollow, at Wellfleet;
Nauset, at North Eastham; Orleans, at Orleans; Chatham, at Chatham;
and Monomoy, on Monomoy Island. Since that time four new
stations have been established, the Wood End, High Head, Old Harbor,
and Monomoy Point.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">THE LIFE-SAVERS MESS ROOM, NAUSET STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The life-saving stations on Cape Cod are situated among the sand
hills common to the eastern shores of the Cape, at distances back from
the high-water mark as to insure their safety. In most instances
they are plain structures, designed to serve as a home for the crew
and to afford storage for the boats and other apparatus. In most of
the stations on Cape Cod the lower floor is divided into five rooms—a
mess room, which also serves for a sitting room for the crew,
a kitchen, a keeper’s room, a boat and beach apparatus room. Wide
double-leafed doors with a sloping platform permit the quick and easy
running out of the surf-boat and other apparatus from the station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>The second story contains two rooms: one the sleeping room for
the crew; the other has spare cots for rescued persons, and is also
used as a storeroom.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">THE SIMPLY FURNISHED SLEEPING QUARTERS, CAHOON’S HOLLOW STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>On every station there is a lookout or observatory, from which the
life savers, during the day when the weather is fair, keep a careful
watch of all shipping along the coast. In order that the life-saving
stations may be distinguished from a long distance at sea, they are
usually painted dark red, and as a further aid to shipping, they are
marked by a flagstaff about sixty feet high erected close by them.
This flagstaff is also used to signal passing vessels by the International
code. These stations are manned from the 1st of August until June
1st following, the keeper remaining on duty throughout the year.
The stations are generally furnished with two surf-boats (supplied
with oars, life preservers, life-boat compass, drag, boat-hooks, hatchet,
heaving line, knife, bucket, and other outfits), boat carriages, two sets
of breeches-buoy apparatus (including guns and accessories), carts for
the transportation of the apparatus, a life-car, cork-jackets (life preservers),
Coston signals, signal rockets, signal flags of the International and
General signal code, medicine chests with contents, patrol lanterns,
barometer, thermometer, patrol clocks, the requisite furniture for
housekeeping by the crew and for the succor of rescued persons, fuel,
oil, tools for the repair of the boats and apparatus, and minor repairs
to the buildings, and the necessary books and stationery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>With the International and General code of signals, shipping,
when miles at sea, can, by this means, open communication with the
stations, be reported, obtain latitude and longitude, or, if disabled,
can thus send for assistance.</p>

<p>All the life-saving stations on Cape Cod are connected by telephone
with lines running to central stations in Provincetown and Chatham.
Close watch of the movements of all shipping is in this way easily
maintained, and in time of disaster help is quickly summoned and
obtained from one station to another.</p>

<h3>SALARIES OF THE KEEPERS AND SURFMEN.</h3>

<p>The keepers of the life-saving stations receive $900 per year for
their services, and the surfmen $65 per month.</p>

<p>In the early history of the life-saving service the keepers received
but $200 per year, later their salary was increased to $400, then to
$700, and, finally, to the present figure.</p>

<p>The surfmen in the early days of the service received but $40
per month, later it was increased to $45, then to $60, and, finally,
to the present sum.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the opening of the “active season,” August 1 of each year, the
men assemble at their respective stations and establish themselves for
a residence of ten months, being allowed one day in seven to visit
their homes between sunrise and sunset. They arrange for their
housekeeping, usually forming a mess, each man taking turns by the
week in cooking. The crew is organized by the keeper arranging
and numbering them in their supposed order of merit, the most competent
and trustworthy being designated as No. 1, the next No. 2,
and so on. These numbers are changed by promotion as vacancies
occur, or by such rearrangement from time to time as proficiency in
drill and performance of duty may dictate. Whenever the keeper is
absent, the No. 1 surfman assumes command and exercises the keeper’s
functions. When the rank of the crew has been fixed, the keeper
assigns to each his position and prepares station bills for the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
watch, night patrol, boat and apparatus drill, care of the station, etc.
Then all is ready for the active work and the watch of the sea and
shore that never ceases, day or night, until the close of the active
season ten months later.</p>

<p>The patrol of the beaches each night, and during thick weather
by day, by which stranded vessels are promptly discovered and the
rescue of the imperiled crews made the object of effort by the life
saver, distinguishes the United States Life-Saving Service from all
others in the world, and in a great measure accounts for its unparalleled
triumphs in rescuing shipwrecked seafarers.</p>

<p>If the surfman sights a vessel in distress or running into danger
during the night, he fires a brilliant red Coston signal which he always
carries. This is a signal to the shipwrecked crew
that they have been seen and assistance has been
summoned, and to the crew of a vessel which is
approaching the danger line along the coast that it
is time to haul offshore.</p>

<figure id="i034" class="figleft" style="max-width: 8em;">
  <img src="images/i034.jpg" width="598" height="1513" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">COSTON SIGNAL.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>During the daylight on clear days the watch is
kept from a lookout on the station, or by observation
from points where the entire beach and sea limits
of the station’s district can be clearly seen. Foggy
days, and during thick weather, and every night,
fair or foul, the watch is by the patrol of every foot
of the water front of each district. The stations are
located about five miles apart, and the district patrol
beats of each are thus about two and one-half miles
on either side of the station. The boundaries of
each district are marked by a little hut in some protected
spot on the beach called “The half-way
house,” except at the Wood End Station. The night
patrol is divided into four watches, one from sunset to 8 o’clock (the
dog watch), one from 8 to 12, one from 12 to 4, and one from 4 to
sunrise. Two surfmen are designated for each watch.</p>

<p>When the time for their patrol arrives, the surfmen set out from
the station, in opposite directions, keeping well down on the beach as
near the surf as possible until they reach the half-way house. Here
they get warmed, and the surfmen from the adjoining station are met
and checks exchanged. If a patrolman fails to meet the patrolman
from the adjoining station at the half-way house, he, after
waiting for a reasonable time, continues his journey until he either
meets the patrolman or reaches the other station and ascertains the
cause of failure. He thus patrols the neglected shore and is at hand
to assist in case of disaster detaining the other patrolman. At the
stations where the patrolmen carry watchmen’s time-clocks the key is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
secured to a post at the end of the beat, and the patrolman is required
to reach it, wind the clock, and must bring back the dial in his clock
properly recorded.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>HALF-WAY HOUSE, WHERE SURFMEN FROM ADJOINING STATIONS MEET AND EXCHANGE

<p>These houses are connected with the stations by telephone, and often from here the keepers are notified of

</figcaption></figure>

<p>The means employed at the life-saving stations for rescuing persons
from wrecked vessels is everywhere essentially the same, either a life-boat
is sent out through the surf or the breeches-buoy, or life-car used.
The rescues by boat are the most thrilling and hazardous. The method
of establishing communication with stranded vessels is over a century
old, successful experiments with this method having been made as early
as 1791 by Lieutenant Bell of the Royal Artillery. He demonstrated
the practicability of the method by means of a mortar, which carried a
heavy shot four hundred yards from a vessel to the shore. Lieutenant
Bell also observed that a line might be carried
from the shore over a stranded vessel
by the means of his mortar, but the credit
for the actual execution of this method of
establishing communication is given to
Capt. G.&#160;W. Manby, according to a report
of a committee of the House of Commons,
dated March 10, 1810. A London coach-maker
first conceived the idea of a life-boat.
The present type is the product of
a century’s devoted study and experiment.</p>

<figure id="i035_2" class="figright" style="max-width: 8em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">A SURFMAN’S CHECK.
</figcaption></figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>Practice drills in the use of the breeches-buoy and surf-boats are
carried on constantly at each station, until so proficient are the crews
that practice rescues are often made in less than three minutes. The
practice is carried on under conditions as near active work in a
disaster as are possible, and a description of a drill will give the best
idea of actual work at a wreck.</p>

<p>For the practice with the beach apparatus, the breeches-buoy, each
station has a drill ground prepared by erecting a spar, called a
wreck pole, to represent the mast of a stranded vessel seventy-five
yards distant. This is over the water, if possible, from the place
where the men operate, which represents the shore.</p>

<figure id="i036" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i036.jpg" width="1421" height="938" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">TAKING A MAN ASHORE WITH THE BREECHES-BUOY. LYLE GUN IN FOREGROUND.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Each man knows in detail every act he is to perform in the exercise
from constant practice, and as prescribed in the Service Manual. At
the word of command they drag the apparatus to the drill ground,
where they effect a mimic rescue by rigging the gear and taking a
man ashore from the wreck pole in the breeches-buoy. If one month
after the opening of the active season a crew cannot accomplish the
rescue within five minutes, it is considered that they have been remiss
in drilling.</p>

<p>No such celerity, however, is expected of the life savers in effecting
rescues from shipwrecks, when storm, surf, currents, and motion of
the stranded crafts conspire to obstruct. The hastening of the work
of mimic rescue, however, gives the life-savers the utmost familiarity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
with the apparatus and prepares them for working speedily and
successfully in utter darkness and under the most trying weather
conditions.</p>

<p>The boat practice consists in launching and landing through the
surf, capsizing and righting the boat, and practice in handling the
oars. Drill signaling is interrogating each surfman as to the meaning
of the various flags, the use of the code book, and actual conversation
carried on by means of sets of miniature signals provided for each
station.</p>

<p>The beach apparatus, the breeches-buoy, is used to effect the rescue
of shipwrecked seafarers when vessels have stranded near the shore
and the conditions make it inexpedient to use the surf-boats. At such
times the apparatus is hauled to the scene in the beach cart; horses,
kept at all the stations for the purpose, assisting the life savers in the
work.</p>

<figure id="i037" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i037.jpg" width="1395" height="937" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">READY FOR A PRACTICE DRILL WITH THE BREECHES-BUOY AND FLAGS.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Frequently the storms which sweep the beaches are so violent that
the horses refuse to pull the cart, and the life savers are then obliged
to cover the head of the animals before they can be induced to face
the fury of the elements. The life savers when on such journeys are
usually driven to the back of the beaches by the tides, and the task of
dragging the apparatus over the sand dunes is extremely difficult and
hazardous.</p>

<p>The “cut throughs” in the beaches, places where during storms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the seas rush through to the lowlands, further contribute to the dangers
that confront the life savers as they rush along with the apparatus.</p>

<p>These “cut throughs” are also the dreaded menace of the surfmen
on patrol, during stormy weather and high tides, the seas, as they
sweep through them, often entrapping the life savers, throwing them
down, burying them in the rushing waters, and jeopardizing their
lives.</p>

<p>As soon as the life savers reach the scene of disaster, the Lyle gun
is quickly taken from the cart, loaded, sighted, and fired, the captain,
who sights and fires the gun, taking good care that he has sent the
shot flying through the storm well to the windward of the wrecked
vessel, so that if the shot should fail to go across the vessel, yet
beyond it, the line will be carried to the wreck by the force of the
gale.</p>

<figure id="i038" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i038.jpg" width="1407" height="918" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">LIFE SAVERS AND HORSE HARNESSED TO SURF BOAT CART READY TO GO TO A WRECK.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The work of burying the sand anchor, getting the crotch, whip line,
hawser, and breeches-buoy ready is speedily accomplished. Torches
are kept burning by the life savers to tell those on the wrecked vessel
that assistance is at hand and the life savers are at work, and even if
the imperiled crew do not hear the report of the gun, which has fired
a shot to the vessel, they at once begin a search for the shot-line
which is invariably found somewhere in the rigging.</p>

<p>The captain, with the shore end of the shot-line in his hand, waits
for a signal from the ship that the line has passed over the vessel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
that the crew have found it and are ready to proceed with the work
of rescue. A tail-block with a whip, an endless line rove through it,
is made fast to the shot-line, and the wrecked seafarers haul it aboard
their vessel as speedily as possible. Attached to the tail-block is a
tally board with the following directions in English and French
printed on <span class="locked">it:—</span></p>

<p>“Make the tail of the block fast to lower mast well up. If the masts
are gone, then to the
best place you can find.
Cast off shot-line, see
that rope in the block
runs free, and show
signal to shore.”</p>

<p>The foregoing instructions
having been

<p>As soon as the life
savers get a signal
from the vessel that
the tail-block has been
made fast, they “tie”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
bend on a three-inch
hawser to
the whip, the
endless line, and
by it haul the
hawser off to the
vessel. Occasionally
circumstances
permit
wrecked crews to
assist in this part
of the work, but
usually the life
savers are compelled
to do it
alone. To the
end of the hawser, which has been bent on to the whip, the endless
line, is also attached a tally board with the following directions in English
and <span class="locked">French:—</span></p>

<p>“Make the hawser fast about two feet above the tail-block; see all
clear, and that the rope in the block runs free; show signal to the
shore.”</p>

<figure id="i040_1" class="figleft" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img src="images/i040_1.jpg" width="1398" height="925" alt=" ">

<p>These instructions being obeyed, the result will be shown as in
<a href="#i040_2">Figure 2</a>.</p>

  <img src="images/i040_2.jpg" width="1381" height="900" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">FIGURE 3.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Particular care must be taken that there are no turns of the whip,
the endless line, around the hawser; to prevent this the end of the
hawser is taken up between the parts of the whip, the endless line,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
before making it fast. When the hawser is made fast to the wrecked
vessel, the whip, the endless line, is cast off from the hawser, and the
life savers, having been signaled to this effect, make the shore end of
the hawser fast to the strap of the sand anchor.
The crotch is then
placed under the
hawser and raised,
and the latter drawn
as taut as possible,
thus making a slender
bridge of rope
between the vessel
and shore. The
traveler block, from which is suspended the breeches-buoy, is then
put on the hawser, the whip, the endless line, made fast to breeches-buoy,
and thus hauled to and from the vessel, as shown in <a href="#i041_1">Figure 3</a>,
which represent the apparatus rigged with the breeches-buoy
hauled out to the vessel.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">SHOT USED WITH LYLE GUN.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The life savers always carry a good supply of shot and lines with
them, and if the first shot fails to carry the line to the vessel, which
seldom occurs, owing to the skill of those who have charge of this
important branch of the work, a second one is promptly fired. The
work of hauling the breeches-buoy to and from a wrecked vessel is an
arduous task. The whip, the endless line, after passing through the
seas, becomes coated with ice and sand, which cuts the mittens and
lacerates the hands of the surfmen in a fearful manner at times.</p>

<p>The captain and one of the life savers rush into the surf and take
the rescued persons out of the breeches-buoy as soon as it reaches
the beach, while the other members of the crew stand ready to again
send the breeches-buoy off to the wreck as soon as one rescue has been
accomplished. In this way one
after another of shipwrecked crews
are brought ashore.</p>

<figure id="i041_2" class="figright clear" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img src="images/i041_2.jpg" width="1297" height="624" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">LYLE GUN, SHOWING SHOT PROTRUDING
FROM THE MUZZLE.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Women and children and helpless
persons are landed first from
wrecked vessels. Children when
brought ashore in this way are held
in the arms of some elder person
or securely lashed to the breeches-buoy.
The instructions to mariners are to remain by the wreck until
assistance arrives, unless the vessel shows signs of immediately breaking
up. If not discovered immediately by the patrol, the crews of
wrecked vessels are instructed to burn rockets, flare up, or other lights,
and if the weather is foggy to fire guns.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances should the crew of wrecked vessels attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
to land through the surf in their own boats, until the last hope of assistance
from shore has vanished. Often when comparatively smooth
at sea, a dangerous surf is running alongshore, which is not perceptible
three or four hundred yards offshore, and the surf when viewed
from a vessel never appears so dangerous as it is. Many lives have
been unnecessarily lost by crews of stranded vessels being thus deceived
and attempting to land in the ship’s boats.</p>

<p>After a crew has been rescued the work of recovering the apparatus
is quickly accomplished, and every part of it except the shot is invariably
recovered, and often even the shot is also saved. This is done
by a hawser cutter, which is pulled off to the wreck on the hawser the
same as the breeches-buoy, cutting the hawser off close to where it is
attached to the wrecked vessel. The life savers then haul the apparatus
through the sea to the shore.</p>

<p>The first gun used for throwing a line to stranded ships was of cast
iron, and weighed two hundred and eighty-eight pounds, and threw a
shot weighing twenty-four pounds, with an extreme range of four hundred
and twenty-one yards. This soon gave place to an improved
gun, which was of cast iron, with steel lining, mounted on a wooden
carriage. This gun weighed two hundred and sixty-six pounds, and
carried a twenty-four pound shot four hundred and seventy-three yards.
The Lyle gun, which is now used by the life savers of Cape Cod, is a
bronze smooth bore gun, weighing but one hundred and eighty-five
pounds, and fires a cylindrical line, carrying shot, weighing about
eighteen pounds, some six hundred and ninety-five yards. This projectile
has a shank protruding from the muzzle of the gun to an eye
in which the line is tied—a device which prevents, to a degree, the
line from being burned off by the ignited gases in firing. As further
protection against this happening, the life savers wet that part of the
line liable to become burned. When the gun is fired the weight and
inertia of the line cause the projectile to reverse. The shot-line is
made of unbleached linen thread very closely and smoothly braided,
is waterproof, and has great elasticity, which tends to insure it against
breaking. The lines in use
vary in thickness according
to circumstances. They
are of three sizes, designated
as number 4, 7, and
9, being respectively 4/32, 7/32,
or 9/32 of an inch in diameter.
Any charge of powder can
be used up to the maximum
six ounces.</p>

<p>The Lyle gunshot line is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
carried in a faking box, so
called, a wooden box with
handles for convenience for
carrying. The line is coiled
on wooden pins, layer above
layer. When brought into
use the pins are withdrawn,
and the line lies disposed in
layers ready to pay out freely
and fly to the wreck without entanglement. While six hundred and
ninety-five yards is the greatest range to be obtained by a Lyle gun,
about two hundred yards is considered the working limit. The line
sags so, at more than two hundred yards, and the currents are usually
so swift, that the crew of a stranded vessel could not haul the whip
aboard their craft at a much greater distance, and in addition any one
being pulled ashore in the breeches-buoy further than that would most
likely perish from the cold and buffeting of the seas before they could
be rescued.</p>

  <img src="images/i043.jpg" width="1543" height="761" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">LIFE-CAR.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The crotch is made of two pieces of wood, three by two inches thick,
and ten feet long, securely bolted together, and crossed near the top
so as to form a sort of X. The sand anchor is two pieces of hard
wood, six feet long, eight inches wide and two inches thick, crossed at
their centers, bolted together, and furnished at the center with a stout
iron ring. It is laid obliquely in a trench behind the crotch. An iron
hook, from which runs a strap of rope, having at its other end an iron
ring called bull’s-eye, is fastened into the ring of the sand anchor.
This strap connects with a double pulley-block at the end of the hawser
behind the crotch, by which the hawser is drawn and kept taut.
The trench is solidly filled in, and the imbedded sand anchor, held by
the lateral strain against the side of the trench, sustains the slender
bridge of rope constituted by the hawser between the stranded vessel
and the shore.</p>

<p>The large majority of vessels now stranded on the shores of the
Cape being coasters, with crews from six to ten men, the breeches-buoy
is invariably used in preference to the life-car. It weighs but
twenty-one pounds. It consists of a common life-preserver of cork,
seven and one-half feet in circumference, to which short canvas
breeches are attached. Four rope lanyards, fastened to the circle of
this cork, meet above an iron ring, which is attached to a block, called
a traveler. The hawser passes through this block, and the suspended
breeches-buoy is drawn between ship and shore by a whip, an endless
line. At each trip it receives but one person, who gets into it with
their legs down through the canvas breeches legs, holding to the lanyards,
sustained in a sitting position by the canvas saddle, or seat of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the breeches, with his legs dangling below. When there is imminent
danger of the vessel breaking up and great haste is required, two persons
get into the breeches-buoy at once, and to further expedite the
work of rescue, the hawser is dispensed with, part of the hauling
line being used for the breeches-buoy to travel on to and from
the wreck.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“A PERILOUS TASK.” LIFE SAVERS GOING TO A WRECKED VESSEL ON PEAKED HILL BARS.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>There are many kinds of life-boats, and various devices for effecting
communication by line with stranded vessels. The type of boats
in use on Cape Cod are the Monomoy and Race Point models. All
these boats are distinctly known as surf-boats. They are constructed
of cedar with white oak frames, and are from twenty-two to twenty-four
feet in length. The surf-boats have air chambers at the ends,
and are fitted with cork fenders along the outer side to protect them
against collisions with hulls or wreckage, and to further aid in keeping
them afloat, and righting lines by which they can be righted if
capsized in the surf. They weigh from seven hundred to one thousand
pounds. In the hands of the skilled surfmen of Cape Cod they
are capable of marvelous action, and few sights are more impressive
than the surf-boat plowing its way through the breakers, at times
riding on top of the surge, at others held in suspension before the
roaring tumultuous wall of water, or darting forth as the comber
breaks and crumbles, obedient to the oars of the impassive life savers.
All these boats are so light that they can be readily transported along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the sandy shores of the Cape under normal weather conditions, and
launched in very shallow water.</p>

<figure id="i045_1" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i045_1.jpg" width="1870" height="381" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>HEAVING STICK.</p>

<p>A small line is attached to this, and the life savers find it a very valuable means of getting a line to a
vessel or piece of wreckage. It can be used advantageously at about fifty yards.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The type of boat that is best suited for one locality, however, may
be ill adapted for another, and a boat that would be serviceable at one
time might be worse than useless at another. On the coast of Cape
Cod the boat service at wrecks is generally not very far off from shore,
and the chief and greatest danger lurks in the lines of surf which must
be crossed, and in the breakers on the outlying shoals.</p>

<p>The self-righting and bailing boat is more unwieldy, not so quickly
responsive to the tactics of the steersman, and not so well adapted to
the general work on Cape Cod. Where long excursions are apt to be
undertaken, and the service is especially hazardous, the men feel safer
in a self-righting and bailing boat, one of which has been introduced
at the new Monomoy Point Station.</p>

<p>When the surf-boat is used to effect rescue it is taken along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
beach to a point as near the wreck as possible, unloaded from the
cart, and at a favorable time run into the raging waters. The keeper
is the last man to get aboard the surf-boat, climbing in over the stern
as she is run into the sea. The life savers who remain ashore to
assist in getting the boat off run waist deep into the sea, helping to
guide the boat, and to prevent her, if possible, from being capsized in
the surf. The keeper steers with a long oar, and with the aid of his
trained surfmen, intent upon his every look and command, guides the
buoyant craft through the surf with masterly skill. He is usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
able to avoid a direct encounter with the heaviest breakers, but if he
is obliged to let them strike him, he meets them directly “head on.”</p>

<p>Although sometimes hurled back upon the beach and broken in
desperate and unavailing attempts at a launch against a resistless sea,
this boat, which might easily be upset, has rarely been capsized in
going through the surf. While there is always great peril in launching
these boats in times of shipwreck, the greatest danger lies in
landing through the surf. The gigantic walls of water speeding to
the shore cannot then be met head on as when the boat is passing out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
and when one of these tumultuous combers break over the stern of
the boat, which, fortunately, has rarely occurred on Cape Cod, the
lives of those aboard the craft are placed in great peril.</p>

<p>In landing the life savers jump into the surf as the boat is about to
touch the beach, and with the assistance of those of the crew who
remained ashore to select a good landing place, the craft is quickly
run up on the beach far out of the reach of the dangerous undertow.</p>

<figure id="i048" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">AFTER A WRECK, SURFMEN OF CAHOON’S HOLLOW STATION CARRYING A BODY TO THEIR
STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>This work is also attended with great danger, the surfmen sometimes
receiving injuries by being struck by the boat, which incapacitates
them from further duty in the service. The keepers and crews
place their faith in the surf-boats which they use, and they are ever
ready to face any sea in which a boat will live.</p>

<p>When a distressed vessel is reached, the orders of the keeper, the
captain of the crew of life savers, who always steers and commands,
must be implicitly obeyed.</p>

<p>There must be no headlong rushing or crowding, and the captain of
the ship must remain on board to preserve order until every other
person has left. Women, children, and helpless persons are taken
into the boat first. Goods or baggage will not be taken into the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
under any circumstances until all persons are landed. If any be
passed in against the keeper’s remonstrance he throws it overboard.</p>

<p>It often happens, however, that some of the crew, and even captains
of wrecked vessels, attempt to get their baggage into the surf-boats.
At a wreck which Captain Cole and his crew went to in the night a
few years ago the captain of the craft insisted that the life savers
should wait until he could get his baggage ready to take ashore.
Captain Cole, in a voice that could be heard above the roar and din of
the storm, commanded the bow oarsmen, who was holding the painter
that kept the surf-boat alongside the wreck, to cut the painter. The
captain of the stranded craft no sooner heard this command than he
jumped into the boat, leaving his effects behind, and was safely taken
ashore.</p>

<p>Persons rescued from shipwreck are taken to the nearest life-saving
station, the weak, sick, and the disabled are treated with remedies
from the medicine chest, supplied under the direction of the Surgeon-General
of the Marine Hospital Service. Those who have escaped
from shipwreck and are wet, hungry, and cold are provided with dry
clothing, warmed, fed, lodged, and cared for until they are able to
leave.</p>

<h3>RESTORING THE APPARENTLY DROWNED TO LIFE.</h3>

<p>The method adopted for restoring the apparently drowned is
formulated into rules which each member of the crew commits to
memory. In drill he is required to repeat these and afterwards
illustrate them by manipulations upon one of his comrades. The
medicine chest is also opened, and he is examined as to the use of its
contents.</p>

<p>The dry clothing is taken from the supply constantly kept on hand
at the different stations by the Women’s National Relief Association,
an organization established to afford relief to sufferers from disasters
of every kind. The libraries at the stations are from the donations of
the Seamen’s Friend Society and sundry benevolent persons. The
food is prepared by the keepers or the station mess, who are reimbursed
by the recipients if they have the means, or by the government.</p>

<p>The life-saving service is attached to the treasury department.
The sea and lake coasts of the United States have an extent of more
than ten thousand miles, and are divided into thirteen life-saving districts,
each under the immediate supervision of a district superintendent.
The chief officer of the service is the general superintendent,
who has general charge of it and of all administrative matters connected
with it. An inspector from the Revenue Marine Service visits
each station monthly during the “active season,” which is ten months,
from August 1 to June 1, and examines and practices the crews in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
their duties. On his first visit, after the opening of the stations each
year, if any are found not up to the standard, they are promptly
dropped from the service. The district superintendents are promoted
from the corps of keepers, and must be residents of the respective
districts for which they are chosen, and are rigidly examined as to
their professional familiarity with the line of coast embraced within
the district and the use of life-boats and all other life-saving apparatus.</p>

<p>The keeper of each station has direct control of all its affairs, and as
his position is one of the most important of the service, the selection
is made with the greatest care.</p>

<figure id="i050" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i050.jpg" width="1410" height="951" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">A RESCUED SHIPWRECKED CREW.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The indispensable qualifications are that he shall be a man of good
character and habits, not less than twenty-one and not over forty-five
years of age, with sufficient education to be able to transact the business
connected with the station, be able bodied, physically sound, and
a master of boatcraft and surfing.</p>

<p>No difficulty is found in filling vacancies that occur among the
keepers, as they must be promoted from the ranks of the surfmen,
and the merits of all the surfmen, having been ascertained by inspection,
drill, and active service, are on record. The keepers are required
to reside at their stations all the year round, and are entrusted with
the care, custody, and government of the station and property. They
are captains of their crews, exercise absolute control in matters of
discipline, lead the men, and share their perils on all occasions of
rescue, always taking the steering oar when the boats are used, and
directing all operations with the other apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<figure id="i051" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i051.jpg" width="956" height="1508" alt="WEEKLY TRANSCRIPT OF JOURNAL.">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p class="p1">The keeper and six men constitute the regular crew at each of the
stations on Cape Cod, except at the Monomoy Station, where the regular
crew is seven men. An additional man called “the winter man”
is added to all stations on December 1 of each year, so that during
the most rigorous part of the season one man, at least, may be left
ashore to assist in launching and beaching of the surf-boat, and to
have charge of the station and perform the extra work that winter
weather necessitates.</p>

<p>The life-saving crews are selected from able-bodied and experienced
surfmen after the rigid examination
required by the department.</p>

<figure id="i052" class="figleft" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img src="images/i052.jpg" width="949" height="1317" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SURFMAN GAGE, ORLEANS STATION,</p>

<p>Dressed for cold night, with time clock, beach lantern, and
coston signal.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The surfmen, in addition
to being obliged to pass a
rigid physical examination
before they can enter the
service, must also pass a
similar examination yearly
before the opening of the
active season. No matter
how long they may have
been in the service, the
hardships they have suffered,
the perils they have
faced, or the great deeds
of heroism they have performed,
if they are found
not to be physically sound
they are dropped from the
service, ruined in health,
without the slightest compensation
for the years of
faithful service.</p>

<p>The profession of a surfman
is entirely different from that of a sailor, being only acquired
by coast fishermen and wreckers after years of experience in passing
in and out through the surf. The method of selecting the life-saving
crews has resulted in securing the most skilful and fearless
surfmen, whose gallant deeds of heroism have made them famous
throughout the land. Upon original entry into the service a surfman
must be a citizen of the United States, not over forty-five years of age.</p>

<p>He is examined as to his expertness in the management of boats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
and the use of other life-saving apparatus, and matters of that character.
He signs articles by which he agrees to reside at the station
continuously during the active season, to perform such duties as may
be required of him by the regulations and by his superior officers, and
also to hold himself in readiness for service during the inactive season
if called upon. For this he receives sixty-five dollars per month. For
each occasion he is called upon, during the two months’ inactive season,
he receives three dollars.</p>

<p>The district superintendents, inspectors, keepers, and crews, the
law says, are to be selected “solely with reference to their fitness and
without reference to their political or party affiliations.”</p>

<figure id="i053" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i053.jpg" width="1415" height="943" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">STRANDED CLOSE TO SHORE.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Every time a wreck occurs the keepers are required to make out and
forward to the department a wreck report, containing answers to a
great number of pertinent questions.</p>

<p>If a life is lost the law requires that a thorough investigation be
instituted with a view of ascertaining the circumstances, and whether
the fatality was due to any neglect or misconduct on the part of the
service. Any misconduct or incompetency at other times is likewise
subject to rigid investigation. The results of the investigations into
the circumstances of loss of life are fully set out in the annual reports
of the service, which the general superintendent is required to make.</p>

<p>Life savers, disabled in the line of duty, are retained upon the payrolls
during the continuance of their disability, not to exceed one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
year, though in certain cases the period may be extended upon recommendation
for a greater period, but not more than two years. In case
of their death from service or from disease contracted in the line of
duty, their widows and children under sixteen years of age are entitled
to be paid during a period of two years the same amount that
the husband or father would have received.</p>

<p>In addition to saving the lives of the imperiled, an important part of
the duty of the life savers is that of saving property. The amount of
property saved annually by these guardians of the coast largely exceeds
the cost of maintenance of the service. The keepers are authorized
and required by law to take charge of and protect all such
property until claimed by those legally entitled to receive it, or until
otherwise directed by the department as to its disposition. The
keepers have the powers of the inspectors of customs and faithfully
guard the interests of the government in all dutiable wrecked
property.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">LIFE SAVERS FLOATING A SCHOONER.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Doubtless the United States Life-Saving Service system appears to
be an expensive and elaborate one, but it must be remembered
that, putting aside entirely the consideration of the value of human
life, which is beyond computation, it saves many times its cost
in property alone, and that it fulfils the functions usually allotted
to several different agencies. It rescues the shipwrecked by both
the principal methods which humane ingenuity has devised for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
purpose, and which, in some countries, are practiced separately
by two distinct organizations; it furnishes them the subsequent
succor which elsewhere would be afforded by shipwrecked mariners’
societies; it guards the lives of persons in peril or of drowning
by falling into the water from piers and wharves in the harbors of
populous cities, an office usually performed by humane societies; it
nightly patrols the dangerous coast for the early discovery of wrecks
and the hastening of relief, thus increasing the chances of rescue, and
shortening by hours intense physical suffering and the terrible agony
of suspense; it places over peculiarly dangerous points upon the
rivers and lakes a sentry prepared to send instant relief to those who
incautiously or recklessly incur the hazard of capsizing in boats; it
conducts to places of safety those imperiled in their homes by the torrents
of flood, and conveys food to those imprisoned in their homes
by inundation and threatened by famine; it annually saves, unaided,
hundreds of stranded vessels, with their cargoes, from total or partial
destruction, and assists in saving scores of others; it protects wrecked
property after landing from the ravage of the elements and the rapine
of plunderers; it extricates vessels unwarily caught in perilous positions;
it averts numerous disasters by its flashing signals of warning
to vessels standing in danger; it assists the custom service in collecting
the revenues of the government; it pickets the coast with a guard,
which prevents smuggling, and, in time of war, surprise by hostile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
forces, which makes the service unlike all other organizations established
for similar purposes.</p>

<p>The distinction of having founded and created the United States
Life-Saving Service having been the subject of much discussion in
recent years, General Superintendent Kimball, in his report to the
Secretary of the Treasury as to the claims of W.&#160;A. Newell, as the
originator of the system of the Life-Saving Service of the United
States, in conclusion states as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“The fact is, the credit of originating and developing the United
States Life-Saving Service cannot truthfully be awarded to any single
individual.</p>

<p>“In Congress and out of Congress many men have contributed, some
in a great and some in a less degree to the success of its fortunes.
To even write down the names of the legislators in both houses of
Congress, who have been its advocates and champions, and to refer
ever so briefly to their valuable assistance, would occupy much space
and require considerable research, but there occurred to me at once
as conspicuous among the host of its promoters, Senators Hannibal H.
Hamlin, O.&#160;D. Conger, W.&#160;E. Kenna, W.&#160;J. Sewell, and William P.
Frye, and Representatives S.&#160;S. Cox, Charles B. Roberts, John Lynch,
James W. Cobert, and Jesse J. Yeates. Presidents of the United
States and various Secretaries of the Treasury have promoted its welfare.
Many officers of the life-saving service also, as well as officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
detailed to it from the Revenue Cutter Service, have, from time to
time, suggested and assisted to carry into effect important improvements.</p>

<p>“The life-saving service was not designed and laid out at one stroke,
in a single comprehensive plan, as an architect designs a building, or
a military genius, perhaps, devised a scheme of army organization,
but its system and development have been accomplished step by step,
day teaching unto day the necessity and wisdom of each successive
measure of progress.”</p>

<h3>CAPT. BENJAMIN C. SPARROW.</h3>

<p>Capt. Benjamin C. Sparrow, superintendent of the second life-saving
district, was born in Orleans, Oct. 9, 1839. He is a lineal descendant
of Richard Sparrow, who came over in the ship <i>Ann</i>, landing at
Plymouth. When a boy he always accompanied his father, a well-known
life saver and wrecker, to the shipwrecks that occurred along the coast,
and at an early age became familiar with the scenes of disaster from
which the shores of Cape Cod have become noted.</p>

<p>In those early days, long before the establishment of United States
life-saving stations on Cape Cod, volunteer crews responded to the
calls for assistance when there was a wreck along the coast. There
were others who engaged in the work of saving lives and of wrecking,
or assisting distressed vessels, and they were known as “beach
combers.”</p>

<p>Captain Sparrow was a “beach comber” for many years, and relates
thrilling and interesting incidents that occurred during his experience.
After finishing his education in the public schools of his native town,
he taught in the public schools in the adjoining town of Eastham.</p>

<p>He entered Phillips Academy to prepare himself for the legal profession,
and was a student there at the outbreak of the Civil War.
The war had hardly begun, however, before he left college, and enlisted
in the regular army, in the engineer battalion attached to the
headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, serving in this capacity
until 1864. During his term of service he endured much hardship,
being a prisoner at Belle Isle in the summer of 1862.</p>

<p>At the close of the war he returned to his home in East Orleans,
where he has since resided. On Dec. 25, 1866, he married Miss
Eunice S. Felton, of Shutesbury, Mass.</p>

<p>He has been connected with the United States Life-Saving Service
for thirty years, or since the time of its reorganization, his appointment
as district superintendent being a part of the plan adopted by
the government to stamp out the evils which existed in the service at
the time.</p>

<p>Captain Sparrow in the thirty years in which he has been superintendent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
of the second district has been actively engaged in the arduous
duties of his calling, and to his efforts is due the success in
securing the discipline and efficiency in this hazardous service in the
district under his charge.</p>

<figure id="i058" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. B.&#160;C. SPARROW, DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT UNITED
STATES LIFE-SAVING STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>His home is connected by telephone with all the stations along the
shores of the Cape, and the moment a wreck is reported to him he is
away to the scene.</p>

<p>Ofttimes he has been obliged to travel many miles on foot in the
teeth of a raging gale and driving storm to reach the scene of a disaster,
yet he has attended nearly every wreck that has taken place
along the shores of Cape Cod during the past thirty years.</p>

<p>The veteran captain has often shared the hardships and braved the
perils with the life savers in their work along the beaches, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
hardships of thirty years have left their deep imprint upon him. The
night that the schooner Calvin B. Orcutt was wrecked on Chatham
bars, Captain Sparrow suffered such hardship going to the scene that
his eyesight has since been seriously impaired.</p>

<p>The life-saving department recognized Captain Sparrow’s ability
from the first by appointing him on the board of experts to examine
new appliances and methods proposed for use by the department.</p>

<p>This position he has filled with great credit to himself and to the
betterment of the department to the present.</p>

<figure id="i059" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">

</figcaption></figure>

<p>Captain Sparrow has always taken an active interest in the affairs of
his town, and his fellow-citizens have honored him from time to time
with public offices within their gift. To the life savers of Cape Cod
Captain Sparrow has ever been a staunch friend.</p>

<h3>HIGHLAND STATION.</h3>

<p>This station derives its name from the Highlands of Cape Cod
which are in the immediate vicinity, and is one of the original nine
stations built on Cape Cod in 1872. It is seven-eighths of a mile
west of Cape Cod Highland Light, and about one and one-half miles
from the North Truro village.</p>

<figure id="i060" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i060.jpg" width="1406" height="936" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">HIGHLAND STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Its approximate position as obtained from the latest coast survey
charts is latitude north 42° 02′ 55″, longitude west 70° 04′ 20″. Shoals
run parallel with the shores at this station, and many appalling disasters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
have occurred there since the station has been established. The
surfmen exchange checks with the surfmen from the High Head
Station on the west patrol, which is about one and three-quarter miles,
and with the surfmen from the Pamet River Station on the east patrol,
which is about two and one-half miles. On the east patrol the surfmen
are unable at times to follow the beach, the tides forcing them to
grope their way along the tops of the cliffs, which, in many places, rise
one hundred feet above the level of the sea. So steep are the cliffs at
points along the east patrol, that the surfmen have ropes extending
from the top to the bottom by which they are able to reach the top
when driven from the beach by the tides. In attempting to climb one
of these steep cliffs on a stormy night a few years ago, Henry Baldwin,
a substitute at this station, had the bank break under him, and
falling to the beach below, a distance of nearly fifty feet, fractured
his hip and received multiple injuries. When the unfortunate surfman
did not return to the station at the appointed time, a surfman
was sent out to search for him. No trace of him could be found,
however, and at four o’clock in the morning Captain Worthen called
all hands, and after a search of a few hours, the injured surfman was
found on the beach attempting to crawl to the station. This shows
one of the perils which confront the surfmen attached to this station.
John Francis, a surfman, who, after eighteen years of service at this
station, was forced to resign from it on account of injury to his eyesight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
had a narrow escape from death while a member of this station
crew. Francis was attempting to make his way along the beach to a
point where he could climb to the top of the cliffs. The sea was
running high, and the great undertow catching Francis, threw him
down and carried him far out from the shore. He struggled desperately,
and by the merest chance succeeded in making his way out
of the surf, when thrown upon the shore by a mountainous wave. He
was more dead than alive when he reached the station. Surfman
William Paine, of this station, had a fearful experience during a
blinding snowstorm. Paine got lost, his eyes becoming frostbitten so
that he could not open them. He walked about all night in a little
grove of pine woods to keep from freezing, and was found the following
day by his comrades.</p>

<figure id="i061" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i061.jpg" width="1437" height="959" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">NEAR THE HIGHLAND STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>There are three surf-boats at this station, two for active service, one
for drilling the crew, two beach carts with full sets of apparatus, and
a life-car. One of the surf-boats and a beach cart are kept in a house
near the shore. “Nellie,” a horse owned by Captain Worthen, is
employed at the station during the winter months. Cats and dogs are
the pets of the surfmen, a number of them living about the station.</p>

<p>Captain Worthen has been keeper of this station since it was placed
in commission, a period of over thirty years. During that time there
is a record of twenty-seven wrecks within the province of the station.
The records as to the number of persons taken ashore is not plain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
although it is certain that one hundred and fifty have been rescued by
Captain Worthen and his crew.</p>

<p>Only one crew in the whole history of the station has been rescued
by means of the breeches-buoy, the crew, ten in number, of the British
bark <i>Kate Harding</i>, from Barbadoes, which stranded during a
fierce gale and dangerous sea, were thus safely taken ashore. The
bark became a total wreck.</p>

<h3>CAPT. EDWIN P. WORTHEN.</h3>

<p>Capt. Edwin P. Worthen, keeper of the Highland Life-Saving Station,
has the distinction of being the oldest keeper in point of years of
service, not only on Cape Cod, but in the United States. He has been
in the life-saving service for more than thirty years, and has been the
keeper of the Highland Station since the station’s establishment. He
is a native of Charlestown, Mass., having been born in that city sixty-five
years ago, or July 27, 1837, to be exact.</p>

<figure id="i062" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i062.jpg" width="1399" height="932" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>ALONG THE SHORE AT HIGHLAND LIGHT.</p>

<p>Showing steps which life savers climb when driven to the top of the cliffs by the seas.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Captain Worthen is indeed a warrior of the sea, a triumphant fighter
of the storms that sweep the coasts of Cape Cod, a life saver who has
witnessed some of the most awful scenes of terror at time of shipwreck,
and heroically rescued seafarers from the very jaws of death.</p>

<p>When but eight years of age, Captain Worthen went to sea as cook
on a fishing and coasting vessel, continuing to follow the sea in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
capacity or another until he was thirty-five years of age, when he was
appointed keeper of the Highland Station.</p>

<p>Not one of the original crew of the Highland Station is in the service
at present, save the veteran keeper Captain Worthen. For thirty
years he has made the station which he helped to build his home, and
has been a faithful and vigilant guardian of the coast. Skilled in
the art of handling boats through the surf, absolutely fearless when
duty calls, he has an enviable record as a life saver. Under his watchful
eye, careful guidance, and discipline, the members of his crew have
been trained to perfection in the art and science of managing boats
in the most riotous waters, and are ever ready to follow their keeper.</p>

<figure id="i063" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i063.jpg" width="945" height="1399" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. EDWIN P. WORTHEN, KEEPER OF HIGHLAND STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>In his thirty years of service as keeper on the dangerous coast of
Cape Cod, he has assisted at nearly all the wrecks that have occurred
in the region of the “Highlands,” yet he never received an injury of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
any kind in that whole time. Captain Worthen has always taken a
deep interest in the welfare of the life savers, and his associates of the
Surfman’s Mutual Benefit Association of the United States have
honored him with the office of chairman of the District Committee.</p>

<p>While Captain Worthen has witnessed many changes in the service
along the shores of Cape Cod, the shifting treacherous sand bars near
his station, however, still remain as a menace to the mariner, and continue
to levy a fearful tribute on the shipping around Cape Cod. The
sands along the coast there are literally strewn with half-buried skeletons
of wrecked vessels, while unmarked mounds in the little village
graveyards near by, tell a sorrowful tale of the fearful sacrifice of
human life. The first wreck which Captain Worthen went to after his
appointment as keeper was on Dec. 25, 1872, before the station was
built. With volunteers he rescued fourteen men, the whole crew of
the German bark <i>Francis</i>, which became a total loss. The same night
another vessel, the <i>Peruvian</i>, was lost on the coast, and her crew of
twenty-eight perished. The captain of the <i>Francis</i> died two days
later, and was buried near the Highland Station, Captain Worthen
caring for his grave ever since.</p>

<p>Captain Worthen enjoys good health, despite his age and the great
number of years he has served as a life saver, and seems destined to
enjoy a long life. He married Julia E. Francis.</p>

<h3>HIGHLAND CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is William P. Paine. He was born in North
Truro in 1866, and has been in the life-saving service for twelve
years, all of which have been spent at this station. From his boyhood
days Surfman Paine was a boatman and fisherman along the
shores of Cape Cod, and was well accustomed to braving the hardships
and facing the perils that fall to the lot of a life saver. He
married Edith L. Hopkins.</p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is Hiram R. Hatch. He was born in Truro, is
forty-four years of age, and has been in the life-saving service for
twenty-one years. Surfman Hatch went to sea when a boy, shipping
before the mast on a coasting vessel. He followed the sea until he
was twenty-three years of age, and was a skilled boatman when he
joined the service. In his long years of experience as a surfman
he has had many thrilling escapes, and has proved a faithful and able
life saver. He married Sarah W. Small, and is the father of a
daughter.</p>

<p>The No. 3 surfman is William McFadden. He was born in
Provincetown in 1872, and has been a member of this station crew for
eight years. He had a wide and varied experience on the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
before entering the service, and has made an able and skilled life
saver. He married Sarah R. Knowles.</p>

to sea on coasting vessels and merchant ships, and for several years
he was a whaleman. In his twenty-five years of service as a life
saver he has endured much hardship, has faced the greatest peril in
the performance of his duty, and is a faithful and fearless warrior of
the sea.</p>

a brave and hardy life saver.</p>

<h3>CAHOON’S HOLLOW STATION.</h3>

<p>The Cahoon’s Hollow Station is located on the “back side” of
Cape Cod, two and one-half miles east of Wellfleet. The present
station replaced the one which was destroyed by fire in February, 1893.
The original station was one of the nine that were built on the shores
of Cape Cod in 1872. The station’s approximate position as obtained
from the latest coast survey charts is latitude north 41° 56′ 40″, and its
longitude west 69° 55′ 05″.</p>

<figure id="i066" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i066.jpg" width="1405" height="937" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">CAHOON’S HOLLOW STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The surfmen from this station on the north patrol cover a distance
of about two and one-half miles, meeting and exchanging checks with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the surfmen from the Pamet River Station. On the south patrol the
surfmen have a walk of about four miles, meeting and exchanging
checks with the surfmen from the Nauset Station.</p>

<p>The coast at this station is exceedingly dangerous; sunken rips
stretch out under the sea and extend along the shore for miles.
Owing to the great sand dunes which have been built by the winds,
the surfmen are unable to obtain a good observation seaward from
the lookout on the station, and the day watches are stationed in a
small house on the bluff overlooking the sea.</p>

<p>There are three surf-boats, one dory, two beach carts, breeches-buoys,
etc., and one life-car at this station. Two surf-boats and the
dory are used for the work of rescue and one for practice. The life-car
has never been used save for practice.</p>

<p>At the Cahoon’s Hollow Station since Captain Cole has been keeper,
sixteen vessels of different types have become stranded on the beach
there. On these vessels there was a total of one hundred and twenty-four
persons, and of this number but one person was lost. Those
saved by Captain Cole and his crew were taken ashore in all kinds of
ways, some by the surf-boat, others by the breeches-buoy, and many
were dragged through the surf with lines. Charles H. Ashley, of
Haverhill, was the only person lost within the patrol of the Cahoon’s
Hollow Station. He was a member of the crew of the barge <i>Blackbird</i>,
and was drowned attempting to reach the shore in a small boat.
Of the sixteen vessels that were cast ashore on the beach ten were a
total loss.</p>

<h3>CAPT. DANIEL COLE.</h3>

<p>Capt. Daniel Cole, keeper of the Cahoon’s Hollow Life-Saving Station,
was born in Wellfleet in 1844, and has been in the life-saving service
ever since it was established on Cape Cod, with the exception of
one year. He entered the service when the Cahoon’s Hollow Station
was manned, and after serving as a surfman for a number of years
was appointed keeper twenty-three years ago.</p>

<figure id="i068" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. DANIEL COLE, CAHOON’S HOLLOW STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Captain Cole, in addition to being a veteran life saver, is also a veteran
of the Civil War. When a boy hardly nine years of age he went to sea,
his first trip being to the Grand Banks on a vessel that sailed from
Cape Cod. He continued to go to the Grand Banks year after year
until he went to the West, and engaged in trading on the Great
Lakes. He was a trader on the lakes when the war broke out.
He was but nineteen years of age, but of fine physique, strong,
healthy, appeared much older, and was readily accepted in the 12th
Illinois Regiment, Company K, Second Brigade, 15th Army Corps,
and was soon on his way to the front. He participated in numerous
engagements, and was with Sherman on his “march to the sea.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
When his term of enlistment expired he was discharged, at Louisville,
Ky., and at once returned to his home on Cape Cod. He again went
fishing to the Banks, continuing until the life-saving service was extended
to Cape Cod, when he was prevailed upon to join the new crew
at Cahoon’s Hollow. He continued to serve as a surfman for a
number of years, joining the station crew at the close of each fishing
season. One year, while he was master of a fishing vessel, he remained
out of the service. The following season he joined the station when
the crew went on duty, and has been at the station continuously since
that time. William Newcombe, who was placed in charge of the station
when it was manned, resigned after a few years, and Captain Cole was
placed in command. As a surfman, Captain Cole had shown rare judgment
and exceptional skill in the work of saving life and property, and
his promotion to keeper of such an important station was a merited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
reward. He has made an enviable record as a life saver since keeper,
but one life having been lost within the patrol of his station since he
took charge. Disasters are frequent along the shore near his station,
and the crew have made many heroic rescues, and had numerous thrilling
escapes in devotion to their duty. One of the worst wrecks that have
occurred within the province of the station happened on Dec. 31, 1890,
when the schooner <i>Smuggler</i> became a total loss. The vessel struck
during a furious gale, and was discovered by one of the surfmen about
four o’clock in the morning. Running to the station, a distance of about
two miles, the surfman aroused the keeper and crew, and all hands
started for the wreck in the teeth of the gale, with the beach apparatus
in a wagon drawn by the station horse. The whirlwinds of sand
sweeping along the shore blinded the men, and the horse at times refused
to go. After much hardship, but with little delay, Captain Cole
and his crew reached the scene. The fifteen men, the crew of the
vessel, had been driven into the rigging, and the craft was fast
breaking up and moving along the shore. With great despatch a
shot was fired over the vessel, the breeches-buoy was put in working
order, and the men pulled through the surf from the stranded
vessel to the shore. The life savers suffered terribly from the cold,
and the rescued crew were nearly dead when they reached the shore.
As the last man was pulled out of the surf, the vessel went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
pieces, not a vestige being left to mark the spot where the disaster
took place.</p>

<p>Captain Cole maintains a high standard of efficiency and discipline
at his station, and has a crew of fearless and skilled life savers. Captain
Cole married Harriet Blodget, and is the father of two sons. He
is a member of the J.&#160;C. Freeman Post, G.&#160;A.&#160;R., No. 55, of Provincetown,
the Surfmen’s Mutual Benefit Association, the Royal Arcanum,
and the Adams Lodge, F.&#160;A.&#160;M.</p>

<h3>CAHOON’S HOLLOW STATION CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Freeman W. Atwood. He was born in Wellfleet
in 1846, and has been in the life-saving service for twenty-five
years, all of which have been at this station. Before entering the
service Surfman Atwood was a fisherman and coastwise sailor. He
went to sea when a boy, and from his long experience as a fisherman
and sailor along the shores of the Cape was well prepared for the
work of a life saver. In all his years of experience he has never met
with serious mishap. He has seen much hardship as a member of
this crew and can be relied upon to unflinchingly face the greatest
perils in the performance of his duty. He married Lucy N. Rich,
and is the father of three boys.</p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is Eugene O. Young. He was born in Yarmouth
Port and is forty-nine years of age. Surfman Young has been a
life saver for nineteen years, joining this station when he entered the
service. He was a boatman, fisherman, and coastwise sailor before
entering the service, and has made a valued member of the station
crew, as he is a tried and true life saver. Surfman Young has assisted
at all the wrecks that have taken place at the station during his term
of service, and has suffered much hardship and had many perilous
adventures within that period. He married Susan A. Rich, and has
a family of two girls and one boy.</p>

<p>The No. 3 surfman is Edward Lombard. He was born in Truro in
1865, and has been in the life-saving service for twelve years, three at
the Pamet River Station, the remaining nine at this station. Surfman
Lombard was a fisherman and boatman before he entered the
service. He saw much active service while a member of the Pamet
River Station, and has always proven himself a brave and skilled life
saver. He married Nellie Howes, and has a family of four boys.</p>

<p>The No. 4 surfman is Stanley M. Fisher. He was born in Nantucket
in 1877, and is serving his first year as a life saver. Surfman
Fisher, after spending a few years as a boatman and fisherman along
the shores of Nantucket, went to Texas, where he worked on a stock
ranch. Tiring of this kind of a life, he enlisted in the regular
army, Company K, Sixth Regiment, and went with his regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
to the Philippine Islands, remaining there until the expiration of
his term of service. Fisher, with his regiment, was stationed on
Negroes Island for one year, and also at Panay for a year. He took
part in six hot battles and several minor engagements with the
Philippines, but escaped without the slightest injury. He was a member
of a volunteer crew which rescued a crew from a sunken vessel
in Vineyard Haven Harbor during the gale of November, 1898, receiving
gold and silver medals as a recognition of his bravery.</p>

<p>Fisher is an expert boatman, and under the guidance of Captain
Cole he cannot fail to become an able and skilful life saver.</p>

<p>The No. 5 surfman is James Lopes. He was born in Provincetown
in 1866, and is serving his first year as a life saver, having
joined the crew at this station in August, 1902. Prior to his joining
the service he was a boat fisherman along the shores of the Cape.
He was a member of a volunteer crew which rescued a crew from a
vessel wrecked in Provincetown Harbor during the November gale of
1898, and received a medal in recognition of his bravery. He had a
wide experience in boating and is possessed of the qualities necessary
to make an able life saver. He married Minnie Rogers, and is the
father of one child, a daughter.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is Clarence L. Burch. He was born in
Provincetown in 1875. Surfman Burch is a new man in the service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
having joined in the service in December, 1902. He had been a boatman
and fisherman along the shores of the Cape for a number of
years, and also a coastwise sailor. He went with a party of prospectors
to the Klondike gold region, but remained there a short time, returning
to Cape Cod to engage in fishing. He is skilled in the art of
managing boats in all kinds of weather, and well qualified for the
work of a life saver. He married Dorothy McKenzie, and is the
father of two girls.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is Charles H. Jennings. He was born in
Provincetown in 1878, and is serving his first year as a regular surfman.
Surfman Jennings was a fisherman and boatman before he
entered the service, and had also substituted as a surfman at the
High Head Station, under Captain Kelley. He will receive careful
training under Captain Cole, and will, no doubt, make a skilled and
fearless life saver. He married Edith J. Rogers.</p>

<h3>PEAKED HILL BARS STATION.</h3>

<p>The Peaked Hill Bars Station is another of the original nine stations
which were erected on Cape Cod in 1872. A more bleak or dangerous
stretch of coast can hardly be found in the United States than at this
station. The coast near the station rightly bears the name “Ocean
Graveyard.” Sunken rips stretch far out under the sea at this place,
ever ready to grasp the keels of the ships that sail down upon them,
and many appalling disasters have taken place there. There are two
lines of bars that lie submerged off the shore at Peaked Hill Bars Station,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the outer and inner bars they are called. They run parallel with
the coast line for a distance of about six miles. The outer bars lie
about fourteen hundred yards offshore, the inner bars about six hundred.
These bars are ever shifting, and the depth of water on them
varies in accordance. It is not often that vessels are wrecked on the
outer bars, although they often strike there and are driven over them
only to meet with destruction on the inner bars. The surfmen of this
station have a patrol of about two miles east and west, meeting and
exchanging checks on the westward patrol with the surfmen from
Race Point Station on the eastward with the surfmen of the High Head
Station.</p>

<figure id="i073" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i073.jpg" width="1427" height="944" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">PEAKED HILL BARS STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>When the station was erected there was a long stretch of low beach
between it and the shore, but now sand dunes made by the action of
the wind shut off all view of the ocean except from the lookout tower
on the station. It is at this station that the effect of the flying sand
upon the glass in the windows is plainly seen, the whirlwinds of sand
having made them as rough as if they had been dipped in acid, and
almost shutting out the light of day. This effect of the sand in destroying
the transparency of the window-panes is an object of curiosity
and never-failing wonder to visitors. On the bluff overlooking the
ocean the crew have erected a small building, where the day watches
keep a lookout and members of the crew spend some of their leisure
moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>The station is located two and one-half miles east of Provincetown
village, and its approximate position as obtained from the latest coast
survey charts is latitude north 42° 04′ 40″, longitude 70° 09′ 50″.
From Provincetown the road to the station crosses the great sand
deserts for which that region is noted.</p>

<p>This station is supplied with two surf-boats, one four oared, the
other five, two sets of beach apparatus, breeches-buoys, guns, etc.,
and a practice boat.</p>

<p>Captain Cook and his crew of the Peaked Hill Bars Station have
taken twenty-five persons ashore in their surf-boat, and one in the
breeches-buoy since Captain Cook assumed charge of the station.
The following vessels, which struck on the Peaked Hill Bars, became a
total loss: <i>Willie H. Higgins</i>, <i>Albert L. Butler</i>, <i>Cathie C. Berry</i>,
<i>Kate L. Robinson</i>, and <i>Jennie C. May</i>.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">THE SAND DUNES ON THE WAY TO PEAKED HILL BARS STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Seven men and one woman were taken ashore from the <i>Higgins</i>.
The captain and one sailor were washed ashore from the schooner
<i>Albert L. Butler</i>, which was wrecked during the memorable November
gale of ’98, and one man was taken off by the breeches-buoy,
while two others were taken ashore after the tide went down.</p>

<p>The schooner <i>Cathie Berry</i> stranded during a terrific gale. The
life savers launched their boat and went to her only to find her abandoned.
The schooner <i>Helen</i> came ashore during a bad time; the life
savers went to her in their boat, but none of the crew came ashore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>The schooner <i>Kate L. Robinson</i> carried a crew of seven men, and
all were rescued by Captain Cook and his crew in their surf-boat.
The crew of the <i>Theta</i>, seven in number, together with a woman
passenger, were also taken ashore in the surf-boat, as were two members
of the crew of the <i>Jennie C. May</i>.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN COOK. PEAKED HILL BARS.</h3>

<figure id="i075" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i075.jpg" width="932" height="1377" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. WILLIAM W. COOK, KEEPER OF PEAKED HILL BARS STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Capt. William W. Cook, keeper of the Peaked Hill Bars Station, one
of the most dangerous of all, was born in Provincetown, within sight
of his station, Nov. 3, 1852. He has been in the life-saving service
for twenty years, fourteen years as a surfman and six as keeper at this
station. When a boy he evidenced great love for boats, and after
leaving school, until he entered the life-saving service, he spent nearly
all his time at sea. He was first in the merchant service, but later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
joined the fleet of whaling vessels that cruised on the north and south
Atlantic grounds, gaining a wide experience as a whaleman, and becoming
thoroughly familiar with the handling of boats under the most
trying conditions and roughest weather. When he decided to enter
the life-saving service the department was glad to secure him, and as
an evidence of their faith in his ability, they assigned him to the dangerous
Peaked Hill Bars Station, under the late Capt. Isaac G. Fisher.</p>

<p>For fourteen years Captain Cook patrolled the beaches and faithfully
performed the duties of a surfman, and then succeeded Captain
Fisher as keeper, when the latter was transferred to the Wood End
Station. In all his years of experience, both as a surfman and keeper
of this station, Captain Cook has never had his boat capsized, has
never been overboard from his boat, and has never lost or had a member
of his crew seriously injured in the performance of duty.</p>

<p>Of all the wrecks which Captain Cook and his crew have gone to, one
of the most hazardous undertakings was at the wreck of the three-masted
schooner <i>Willie H. Higgins</i>, in March, 1898, from which they rescued
seven men and one woman in the surf-boat. At the wreck of the
schooner <i>Theta</i>, Captain Cook and his crew made a most daring rescue
of her crew of seven, and the captain’s wife. The rescue was made in
the surf-boat in a riotous sea that threatened to engulf the boat and
drown both rescued and rescuers. The thrilling rescue was witnessed
by a vast multitude that had assembled on the beach, and a mighty
cheer was sent up as willing hands pulled the surf-boat out of the
maddened waters onto the beach.</p>

<p>Captain Cook uses a twenty-one foot steering oar when going to a
wreck in the surf boat, and to this he attributes his great success in
handling the craft under the worst conditions of wind or wave. The
steering oar is the same kind as he used when a whaleman. That he is
skilled in the use of it is evidenced by the enviable record he has made
since he has been keeper of the station. He is a warrior of the sea who
knows no fear when duty calls, and who is ever ready to put off from
the beach to aid distressed seafarers, when it is possible for a boat to
live. He married Annie Young Snow, and is the father of a daughter.</p>

<h3>PEAKED HILL BARS STATION CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Levi A. Kelley. He was born in Provincetown,
and is forty years of age. Surfman Kelley entered the service
in 1884, and was assigned to this station. He is an expert boatman,
and the life of a life saver has not the least terror for him. He
followed the sea for a number of years as a fisherman and sailor, and
became well accustomed to the hardships similar to those of a surfman
before he joined the service. He married Nona B. Lewis, and is
the father of a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is Benjamin S. Henderson. He was born in
Wellfleet in 1855, and has been a member of this station crew for
seventeen years, or since he entered the service. Surfman Henderson
came from a sea-going family, and took naturally to the hard and
perilous work that life savers are called upon to perform. He followed
the sea for a number of years before entering the service. He
married Mary Dears, and is the father of two girls and two boys.</p>

number of trips on fishing vessels, and later entering the merchant
service. He entered the life-saving service in 1881, being assigned
to this station, and has served faithfully in the capacity of a surfman
for nearly twenty-two years. Surfman Fish served his apprenticeship
as a life saver under the late Capt. Isaac G. Fisher. He has had
many thrilling adventures and narrow escapes from death in the
service. He is an expert boatman and as fearless a surfman as patrols
the shores of Cape Cod. He married Mary L. Enos.</p>

<p>The No. 4 surfman is William D. Carlos. He was born in Provincetown
in 1870, and has been in the life-saving service for five years.
Surfman Carlos went to sea when he was seventeen years of age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
engaging in boating and fishing from that time until he entered the
service. He was first assigned to the Chatham Station, where he
remained for one year, being transferred to this station in 1898. He
gained a thorough knowledge of handling boats in the roughest water
while a fisherman, and was well fitted for the work of a surfman along
the dangerous coast of Cape Cod. He married Matilda B. Travis, and
is the father of a boy.</p>

<p>The No. 5 surfman is Charles A. Higgins. He was born in
Provincetown in 1862, and has been in the life-saving service for seven
years. Surfman Higgins followed the vocation of a boat fisherman
from the time he was a young man until he joined the crew at Peaked
Hill Bars. He is an expert boatman and a brave and faithful surfman.
He married Bessie L. Bangs.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is William E. Sylvia. He was born in Provincetown,
and is thirty-two years of age. Surfman Sylvia is a new man,
but has had a wide experience as a sailor and fisherman, and possesses
the other qualities that go to make a successful surfman. He married
Louise Smith.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is Benjamin R. Kelley. He was born in Truro,
and is fifty-seven years of age, the oldest surfman, in point of years,
at this station. Surfman Kelley was assigned to this station when he
entered the service eighteen years ago, and has remained a member of
the crew ever since. He followed the sea for a number of years
before entering the service, and is an old and tried surfman.</p>

<h3>RACE POINT STATION.</h3>

<p>This station is one of the original nine stations erected on Cape Cod
in 1872, and was manned in the winter of 1873. The station is one
and five-eighths miles east of Race Point, from which it derives its
name. Its approximate position as obtained from the latest coast survey
charts is latitude north 42° 04′ 45″, longitude west 70° 13′ 15″.
From Provincetown the station is about four miles distant, and easy
of access over a highway across the sand dunes. The coast at Race
Point is very treacherous, and has been the scene of many wrecks.
The tides run past the point with great velocity, and vessels are frequently
swept to destruction on the sunken rips which lie along the
coast there.</p>

<figure id="i079" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i079.jpg" width="1411" height="938" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">RACE POINT STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The surfmen of this station go over a patrol westward of two and
one-half miles, and eastward about one and three-quarters miles. On
the eastward patrol the surfmen meet and exchange checks with the
surfmen from Peaked Hill Bars Station; on the westward patrol the
surfmen use a time clock, as “Race Run” so called, an inlet through
the beach, prevents them from meeting the surfmen from Wood End
Station. The station is supplied with three surf-boats of the Race
Point model, two beach carts, with guns, breeches-buoys, etc., and a
life-car.</p>

<p>Ninety-two vessels, of all descriptions, have met with disaster near
this station since Capt. “Sam” Fisher has been keeper. On these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
vessels there were over six hundred seafarers, including two women.
Of this number of persons taken ashore, thirty-seven were landed by
the breeches-buoy, the surf-boat being employed to bring the others
that were saved to the shore.</p>

<p>“Nigger,” the horse which is on duty at the Race Point Station, is
a noble and intelligent animal. When storms are sweeping the coast,
“Nigger” shows a restlessness that is not dispelled until fair weather
again prevails. As the surfmen return from their patrol at night,
“Nigger” always gives evidence in some way or another that he is
awake and ready for duty. “Nigger” takes kindly to the work of
dragging the heavy beach apparatus and surf-boat through the sands,
and responds to the call “ship ashore” as lively as the surfmen.
“Nigger” is the pet of all the surfmen, and seems to enjoy having
visitors call to see him.</p>

<h3>CAPT. SAMUEL O. FISHER.</h3>

<p>Capt. Samuel O. Fisher, keeper of the Race Point Life-Saving Station,
was born in Provincetown in 1861, and has been in the life-saving
service twenty-three years, eight of which he spent as surfman at
Peaked Hill Bars Station and fifteen as keeper of this station.
“Sam” Fisher came from a seafaring family and is a near relative of
the late Isaac G. Fisher, a noted life saver. He went to sea as a sailor
on a coasting vessel when a young man. He left the coastwise trade
to go tow boating, which he followed for a short time, when he again
entered the coastwise trade. He was also a fisherman and boatman
off the shores of Cape Cod. He entered the life-saving service when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
nineteen years of age, being assigned to the Peaked Hill Bars Station
under the late Captain Atkins. He was then an experienced boatman,
strong and robust. He had been a member of the station crew but
a short time when he came near losing his life in a terrible tragedy
that took place on the bars near the station.</p>

<figure id="i081" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. “SAM” O. FISHER, KEEPER OF RACE POINT STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>It was at the time the sloop <i>C.&#160;M. Trumbull</i> stranded on Peaked
Hill Bars. Captain Atkins and his brave crew had pulled out to the
stranded sloop and was about to effect the rescue of the imperiled
crew when the surf-boat was capsized, throwing all hands into the raging
sea. Captain Atkins and two members of the crew perished, Fisher
and two others managing to reach the shore after a desperate struggle.
After the death of Captain Atkins, the late Capt. Isaac G. Fisher
was prevailed upon to take charge of the station. Capt. “Sam”
Fisher remained as surfman under Capt. Isaac Fisher until he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
appointed keeper of the Race Point Station, succeeding John W.
Young.</p>

<p>From his experience at Peaked Hill Bars Station Capt. “Sam”
Fisher was well fitted for the arduous duties of keeper of the Race Point
Station. During the fifteen years that he has been keeper of the Race
Point Station he has led his crew to deeds of great heroism. He has
had many narrow escapes from serious injury and death in the performance
of his duty, and was once obliged to retire for a period of
fifty days on account of injuries received while working on a wrecked
schooner. Once he was obliged to swim ashore from an overturned
boat, and several times he has narrowly escaped losing his life going
to wrecks. Lawrence Maddocks, a member of the crew who was
thrown out of the boat with Captain Fisher at the time of the wreck
of the schooner <i>Julia Bailey</i>, died shortly after from the effects of
exposure.</p>

<h3>RACE POINT STATION CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Edwin B. Tyler. He was born in Provincetown,
is thirty-two years of age, and has been in the United States
Life-Saving Service five years. Prior to his joining the service he
engaged in boating and fishing. In this way he obtained a thorough
knowledge of the coast about the tip end of the Cape, and became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
skilled in the management of boats in the surf, all of which has been
of great value to him since he entered the service. Surfman Tyler, in
the few years that he has been in the service, has had his full share of
the hardship that is part of the life of a life saver on Cape Cod. He
married Pauline Ryder.</p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is George H. Burch. Surfman Burch was born
in Provincetown fifty years ago, and in point of years of service he is
the oldest member of the crew of the Race Point Station. He has been
a member of the Race Point Station crew for fifteen years, joining
the station when he entered the service. Surfman Burch went to sea
when a boy, and followed it until he entered the life-saving service.
In addition to being a coastwise sailor, he also went in pursuit of the
whale. He is an old and tried life saver who knows no fear, and on
whom the fifteen years of hardship has left no visible trace. He married
Mary Sylva of Provincetown, and is the father of a son.</p>

<p class="larger">RACE POINT CREW.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The No. 3 surfman is Henry I. Collins. He was born in Truro in
1871. Surfman Collins entered the life-saving service three years ago,
being assigned to this station. Before entering the service he had
followed the sea as a boatman and fisherman from the time he was a
small boy. He is an expert boatman, and was not long in the service
before he demonstrated his worth as a life saver. He married Nellie
Lombard, and is the father of two girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>The No. 4 surfman is Frank Brown. Surfman Brown was born in
Provincetown in 1866. He joined the life-saving service in 1899,
being assigned to the Muskeget Station at Nantucket. After serving
there for several months he was transferred to this station. Surfman
Brown from his long experience as a fisherman and in the
coasting trade is an expert boatman, and also possesses all the other
qualifications necessary to make a life saver. He married Margaret
Sullivan of Provincetown.</p>

<p>The No. 5 man is John B. Bangs. He was born in Provincetown
and is twenty-nine years of age. Surfman Bangs has been in the service
seven years. He was first assigned to the High Head Station
under Captain Kelly and has been connected with this station but one
year. Surfman Bangs from his experience as a coastwise sailor,
fisherman, and boatman found no difficulty in passing the rigid examination
necessary to enter the service, and is a skilled and intrepid
life saver.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is Martin Nelson. Surfman Nelson was born
in Sweden in 1869. He went to sea when about fifteen years of age
and sailed over a great part of the world before he reached the shores
of Cape Cod. He has been in the service four years, being assigned
to the Monomoy Station under the late Captain Tuttle when he entered
the service. Surfman Nelson was also a member of the crew of the
Monomoy Station under the late Captain Eldredge, being transferred
to the Race Point Station but a short time before. Captain Eldredge
and all but one of his boat’s crew lost their lives. Surfman Nelson
came of a seafaring family and seems especially fitted for the hard life
that he has chosen. He married Louise C. Smith, of Provincetown,
and is the father of a boy.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is Eugene R. Conwell. He was born in Provincetown
in 1880, and is the youngest member of the crew of this
station. Surfman Conwell entered the service in June, 1902, being
stationed on the floating station at City Point during the summer
season, coming to this station in December, 1902. Surfman Conwell,
while a young man, is an experienced boatman and has the youth and
vigor that will help to make him a valuable member of any life-saving
crew to which he may become attached.</p>

<h3>HIGH HEAD STATION.</h3>

<p>This station was established and manned in 1883 by Captain Kelley
and a crew of trained surfmen. The station is three and one-half
miles northwest of Cape Cod Highland Light, and its approximate
position as obtained from the latest coast survey charts is latitude
42° 03′ 55″ longitude west 70° 06′ 50″. From Provincetown the station
is about five miles distant. The eastern end of the dreaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Peaked Hill Bars extend along the coast at this station, and from
wrecks that have taken place on these bars the crew of the station
have made many daring rescues. The surfmen at this station exchange
checks with the surfmen from the Highland Station on the east and
the Peaked Hill Bars Station on the west.</p>

<p>The patrol is about one and one-half miles each way, the shortest
patrol on the entire coast of Cape Cod. The station is supplied with
two surf-boats, a practice-boat, three beach carts with guns, breeches-buoys,
etc., and a life-car.</p>

<figure id="i085" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i085.jpg" width="1389" height="922" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">HIGH HEAD STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The practice-boat came from the Peaked Hill Bars Station, and is
the one which was capsized at the wreck of the schooner <i>C.&#160;M. Trumbull</i>
at the time the late Captain Atkins, keeper of the Peaked Hill
Bars Station, and two members of his crew lost their lives. A surf-boat
and beach cart are kept in a house near the beach to be near at
hand in the event of disaster. The horse kept at the station is owned
by Captain Kelley, and is employed by the government during the
winter season, to help drag the apparatus at the time of a wreck.</p>

<p>Capt. Charles P. Kelley, keeper of the High Head Station, with
his crew of life savers, have taken thirty-seven persons ashore in
their surf-boat during the twenty years that Captain Kelley has been
in charge. The breeches-buoy has not been used in active service
within the patrol of the station, however, since Captain Kelley
assumed command. From the schooner <i>Laura Brown</i> five men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
rescued and the vessel saved; from the brig <i>Emily T. Sheldon</i> eight
men were taken ashore, the vessel becoming a total loss. The schooner
<i>Oliver Ames</i>, which stranded near the station, was saved with her
crew of seven.</p>

<p>From the schooner <i>Plymouth Rock</i>, which became a total wreck near
the station, the crew of six were saved. The crew of the <i>Abbie H.
Hodgman</i>, five in number, were saved and the vessel floated. The
sloop <i>Red Rover</i>, which was a total wreck, had her crew of two men
rescued. The schooner <i>Lucia Porter</i>, with a crew of six men, were
saved by the crew of this station, as was the schooner <i>William H. Oler</i>
and her crew, eight in number.</p>

<p>From the schooner <i>Jennie C. May</i> three persons were taken ashore,
the vessel finally becoming a total loss. The schooner <i>Carrie
Richardson</i> had her crew of four men taken off by the life savers, the
vessel becoming a total wreck, and from the schooner <i>Job H. Jackson</i>,
which, also, became a total wreck, the life savers, under Captain
Kelley, rescued the crew of four men.</p>

<h3>CAPT. CHARLES P. KELLEY.</h3>

<p>Capt. Charles P. Kelley, keeper of the High Head Life-Saving
Station, was born in the village of South Yarmouth, Mass., in the
year 1850.</p>

<p>He attended the public schools in his native village until he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
young man, when he went to sea. His first experience being on a
fishing vessel. Later he engaged in the coastwise service, and after a
number of years joined the fleet of merchantmen which, at that time,
carried on an extensive trade with the West Indies.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-nine, Captain Kelley left the merchant service
and joined the crew of life savers under the late Capt. David H. Atkins,
at the Peaked Hill Bars Life-Saving Station.</p>

<figure id="i087" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i087.jpg" width="951" height="1400" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. CHARLES P. KELLEY, KEEPER OF HIGH HEAD.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Captain Kelley was attached to the Peaked Hill Bars Station for
about three years, during which time he had a number of thrilling
experiences and narrow escapes from death in the performance of his
duty.</p>

<p>At the time of the wreck of the sloop <i>C.&#160;M. Trumbull</i>, on Peaked
Hill Bars, Captain Kelley was in the life-boat with Captain Atkins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
going off to the rescue of the imperiled crew, when the latter and
two members of the crew lost their lives.</p>

<p>It was Captain Kelley who discovered the sloop stranded on the
bars. The life-boat was quickly manned and put off to the wrecked
vessel, and in a short time three of the crew were landed on the beach.
A second trip through the breakers was safely made, and the boat was
alongside the sloop, ready to take off the remaining two members, when
the boom of the sloop caught the life-boat under the belt, and capsized
it, throwing all hands into the boiling sea.</p>

<p>The night was intensely dark and the weather freezing cold.
Captain Atkins was never seen, and the other two members of the
boat’s crew perished after repeated attempts to get into their boat.</p>

<p>Captain Kelley, surfman as he was then, together with “Sam”
Fisher, now keeper of the Race Point Station, and Isaiah H. Young
reached the shore after a terrible struggle, and were pulled out of the
surf by the members of the crew who had remained ashore.</p>

<p>All three were more dead than alive. The bodies of Captain Atkins
and the two members of the crew, Elisha Taylor and Frank A. Mayo,
were afterwards found on the beach by the life savers of an adjoining
station.</p>

<p>Captain Kelley had been in the service but about a year when he
passed through this terrible experience, yet he remained at the
dangerous Peaked Hill Bars Station for three years under the late
Capt. Isaac G. Fisher, being transferred to the High Head Station as
keeper when the station was first manned in 1883.</p>

<p>Captain Kelley had such a wide and varied experience when following
the sea, and later as a surfman attached to the Peaked Hill Bars
Station, that he was especially well qualified for the responsible
position of keeper of the High Head Station, where he has been in
command for over twenty years.</p>

<p>During his long term of service as keeper he has been called upon
at times to face the elements when they were in their greatest fury,
yet he has unflinchingly responded to every call, and, with the surfmen
under his charge, have had many thrilling experiences, and endured
untold hardship. Captain Kelley was twice married; his present wife
was Hannah C. Graham. He is the father of one child, a daughter.</p>

<h3>HIGH HEAD STATION CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Fred C. Franzer. He was born in Provincetown,
Aug. 19, 1863, and has been a member of the crew of this
station for sixteen years, or ever since he joined the service. He had
been a boatman, fisherman, coastwise sailor, and whaleman before
entering the service. He is a most experienced life saver, an expert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
surfman, and a faithful coast guardian. He married Catherine Sylvey,
of Provincetown.</p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is Benjamin Kelley. He was born in West Dennis,
and is forty-eight years of age. He went to sea at an early age and
made a number of voyages to the Atlantic whaling grounds, and until
he joined the service, sixteen years ago, had followed the sea in one
capacity or another. Surfman Kelley is at present on sick leave,
suffering from injuries received in the performance of duty, his place
at the station being filled by his son. Until he received the injuries
which compelled him to retire temporarily from the service, he had
faithfully performed the arduous duties of the life of a surfman, and
was an efficient and trustworthy life saver. He married Susan C.
Snow, and is the father of two children, a son and daughter.</p>

A. Pratt, and is the father of three boys.</p>

<p>The No. 5 surfman is David B. Snow. He was born in Wellfleet,
is twenty-five years of age, and has been in the service two years.
He followed the sea from the time he was fourteen years of age until
he entered the life-saving service. He is a skilful boatman and an
efficient life saver.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is Curtis F. Higgins. He was born in Orleans,
and is thirty-two years of age. He has been a member of this crew
for two years, entering the service after following the sea as a boatman,
yachtsman, towboatman, and a steamshipman. From his experience
in the different kinds of work on the water in which he had engaged,
he was well prepared for the work of a surfman, and has made
an able and faithful life saver. He married Leonora B. Jason.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is Samuel C. Mullett. He was born in Chatham,
and is thirty-four years of age. Surfman Mullett is the winter man
at this station, joining the station in December and remaining until
May following. He has been in the service for three years. During
the summer seasons he is a member of the City Point Station, South
Boston. Surfman Mullett followed the sea from the time that he was
a boy until he entered the service. He is an experienced surfman and
well fitted for the hardships that he is called upon to endure as a
life saver. He married Mrs. Bessie Cash.</p>

<h3>WOOD END STATION.</h3>

<p>This station is one of the new type of life-saving stations, with commodious
quarters for the keeper and crew, large boat room and lookout.
It was built in 1896, and manned in 1897. The late Capt. Isaac
G. Fisher, who was keeper of the Peaked Hill Bars Station at the time,
was placed in charge of the station and a picked crew of surfmen.
Captain Fisher continued as keeper until ill-health caused him to resign
from the service. Capt. William Sparrow, now keeper of the
Point Allerton Station, who was No. 1 man under Captain Fisher,
acted as temporary keeper until Captain Bickers was placed in charge.
The station is located on the narrow strip of beach at the tip end of
Cape Cod, Provincetown, one-eighth of a mile east from the Wood End
lighthouse. Its approximate position as obtained from the latest
coast survey charts is latitude north 42° 01′ 15″, longitude west
70° 11′ 30″. From Provincetown the distance to the station over the
sand dunes and along the beach is about three and one-half miles.
Across the head of the harbor, a way that is accessible when the tide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
has ebbed, the distance is much shorter. The station is supplied with
two five-oared surf-boats of the Race Point model, two beach carts,
with guns, breeches-buoys, etc., and one life-car. The patrol from
this station extends three and three-quarters miles north, and two and
one-quarter miles south. This is the only station on Cape Cod where
the surfmen do not meet and exchange checks with the surfmen from
other stations, time clocks being employed to record the performance
of duty of the patrol.</p>

  <img src="images/i091.jpg" width="1406" height="931" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">WOOD END STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>No total wrecks have occurred within the province of this station
since Captain Bickers has been in command, and no persons have
been taken ashore by the crew either in the surf-boat or breeches-buoy,
although a large number of vessels have met with disaster near
there. The following vessels have been assisted and floated by Captain
Bickers and crew: the yawl <i>Adventurer</i>, the barge <i>Paxnos</i>, and the
schooners <i>Clara</i>, <i>Zephyr</i>, <i>Caviar</i>, <i>Manomet</i>, <i>Joseph I. Johnson</i>, <i>St. Bernard</i>,
<i>Marjorie Brown</i>, <i>Gladstone</i>, and <i>Lewis H. Giles</i>. Captain
Bickers and his crew also assisted in the rescue of the two men, members
of the crew of the schooner <i>Two Forty</i>, who had been adrift in
an open boat for fourteen hours.</p>

<p>“Tom,” the pet cat at the Wood End Station, while not being able
to aid in the work of life saving, often goes out with the surfmen on
their lonely patrol along the beaches to keep them company. “Tom”
knows every foot of the beaches and seems to delight in going out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
with the surfmen, whether the weather is fair or stormy. “Tom”
often meets the surfmen half-way along the beach as they are returning
from their patrol, running along ahead of the men as if to show
them the way to the station. “Tom” is the pet of the crew and is
well taken care of by them.</p>

<p>“Jim,” the horse which is at the Wood End Station, is owned by
Captain Bickers, the keeper. He was raised on Cape Cod, and has
been connected with the station for one year or since Captain Bickers
assumed charge of the station. “Jim” is an intelligent animal, and has
upon more than one occasion been of valuable service to the crew, by
hauling apparatus to scenes of disaster. “Jim” knows when bad
weather prevails, and is ever ready to do his share in the work of saving
life or property.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. GEORGE H. BICKERS, KEEPER OF WOOD END STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Capt. George H. Bickers, keeper of the Wood End Life-Saving
Station, was born in Charlestown, Mass., in 1858. He has been in the
life-saving service for eleven years, ten as a surfman at Race Point
and one as keeper of the Wood End Station. After leaving school,
when a young boy, Captain Bickers shipped before the mast on a
coasting schooner. He followed coasting for a few years, when he
went whaling. As a whaleman he learned the art of handling boats
in riotous waters as well as seamanship in all its branches. Captain
Bickers followed the sea until he was thirty-three years of age, when
he entered the life-saving service, being assigned to the Race Point
Station under Capt. “Sam” Fisher. From his experience as a sailor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
and whaleman he was well fitted for the duties of a life saver. He
remained a member of the Race Point crew until the death of Capt.
Isaac G. Fisher, keeper of the Wood End Station, when he was appointed
to fill the vacancy. Captain Bickers enjoyed an enviable
record as a surfman, and has made a record since being keeper of the
Wood End Station that places him in the front rank of life savers.
One disaster followed another near his station soon after he assumed
command, yet not a life was lost, and nearly every craft was saved
from destruction by his brave and vigilant crew. But one mishap has
occurred since Captain Bickers took charge of the station, the capsizing
of the surf-boat while going to a wrecked fishing vessel. The
crew quickly righted their boat, bailed her out, went to the wreck, and
saved the craft from destruction. Captain Bickers has a crew of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
skilled and fearless life savers who are ever ready to obey his commands.</p>

<p>He married Abbie L. Cahoon, and is the father of a son.</p>

<h3>WOOD END STATION CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Francesco A. Silva. He was born in Fayal,
Azore Islands, in 1863, and has been in the life-saving service for six
years, all of which have been spent at this station. Surfman Silva
went to sea when a boy, sailing before the mast on a merchant ship.
Later he became a whaleman, voyaging from one part of the world to
the other in pursuit of the monsters of the deep. Surfman Silva performed
his first work as a life saver under the late Capt. Isaac G.
Fisher, and soon became an experienced and efficient surfman. He
married Julia A. Lornes, and is the father of a son.</p>

N.&#160;Y., in 1872, and has been in the life-saving service for six
years. He shipped as a sailor before the mast on a coasting vessel
when he was a boy, and spent several years in the coasting trade.
Later he made a number of trips on the United States school ship <i>St.
Mary</i>, going on cruises to England, Ireland, and through the Straits
of Gibraltar to the ports along the Mediterranean Sea. Prior to
entering the life-saving service as a regular surfman, he had substituted
at other stations along the shores of Cape Cod. As a substitute
he performed meritorious service, and has made an efficient and brave
life saver. He married Grace May Henderson, and is the father of
two daughters and a son.</p>

<p>The No. 5 surfman is Willie F. Eldredge. He was born in Chatham,
is thirty-six years of age, and has been in the life-saving service
three years. Before entering the service he was a boatman and
fisherman along the Chatham shores, and from his experience in that
work was well prepared for the duties of a surfman. He also substituted
at many of the life-saving stations along the shores of Cape Cod,
and is an experienced and efficient life saver.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is James E. Worth. He was born in Provincetown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
in 1861, and has been in the life-saving service one year. When
a boy Surfman Worth went cod fishing to the Grand Banks, and later
shipped on a merchant vessel and made a great number of trips to the
West Indies Islands and South American ports. After a few years in
the merchant service he became a whaleman, and in that service had
a number of thrilling experiences. After giving up going to sea he
became a baggage-master on the Old Colony Railroad. Later he
entered the employ of the Cold Storage Plant at Provincetown,
remaining there until he entered this service. When he entered the
service he was assigned to the Muskeget Station on Nantucket, and
was later transferred to this station. He is an expert boatman and a
brave and hardy life saver. He married Nellie P. Lewis, and is the
father of two daughters and four sons.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is John N. Lewis. He was born in Provincetown,
and is thirty-eight years of age. Until he entered the service
four years ago, he had followed the sea from a boy. For three years he
was a member of the City Point Station, South Boston, during the summer
seasons, and also spent one season at the Straitsmouth Station,
Cape Ann. Surfman Lewis is a skilled boatman, and has proved that
he can be depended upon to do his duty in any emergency.</p>

<h3>PAMET RIVER STATION.</h3>

<p>The Pamet River Station is another of the original nine stations which
were erected on Cape Cod in 1872. It is located three and one-half
miles south of Cape Cod Highland Light, its approximate position as
obtained from the latest coast survey charts is latitude north 42°
00′ 00″, longitude west 70° 01′ 15″.</p>

<p>The station stands on one of the high sand dunes which line the
ocean shore in Truro village about three miles from the Truro railroad
station. When the station was built it stood several hundred
feet back from high water mark, but the sea has made such great
inroads into the sand dunes at that point on the beach, that the high
water mark is now less than one hundred feet distant from the station,
which will soon have to be moved to insure its safety. Sand bars
with but a small depth of water over them fringe the shore at this
station, extending seaward for several hundred yards, and the history
of the station records many fearful disasters on them. It was
on these dreaded bars that the terrible ocean tragedy, the wreck of
the ship <i>Jason</i>, occurred, and also where the three crafts, the <i>Powwow</i>,
<i>Miles Standish</i>, and the <i>E. Pavey</i>, were wrecked at one time. The
wreck of the <i>Jason</i> was one of the most appalling disasters that has
ever taken place on the shores of Cape Cod, twenty-six lives being
lost. Of the whole crew, Samuel Evans, the ship’s apprentice, was the
only person that managed to reach the shore. Of the whole number,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
thirty-four, aboard the ships <i>Powwow</i>, <i>Miles Standish</i>, and <i>Pavey</i>,
twelve were lost.</p>

<p>The surfmen from this station have a patrol that extends two and
one-half miles north and about an equal distance south, the surfmen
meeting and exchanging checks on the south patrol with the surfmen
from Cahoon’s Hollow on the north with the surfmen from the Highland
Station.</p>

<p>The patrol is exceedingly hazardous and difficult. When the tide
is high the surfmen are driven to the tops of the sand dunes and
obliged to grope their way along the crest of the cliffs, which in many
places are a hundred feet above the sea-level.</p>

<figure id="i097" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i097.jpg" width="1419" height="958" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">PAMET RIVER STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>When the station was manned, Capt. Jonathan Lee was appointed
keeper. He was succeeded by Capt. Nelson W. Weston, George W.
Kelley, and Capt. John H. Rich, the latter being succeeded by the
present keeper, Capt. George W. Bowley.</p>

<p>Captain Bowley has been in charge of this station but a little over
one year, during which time no wrecks have occurred within the territory
covered by the patrol from the station, and the crew has been
called upon but twice to assist disabled vessels. The first assistance
rendered by Captain Bowley after his appointment as keeper was to a
big tug boat which got caught on the bars off the shore and was in
great peril. The next call was to assist a steam yacht which became
disabled off the shore near the station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>This station is supplied with two surf-boats of the Monomoy model,
two beach carts with full sets of apparatus, and one life-car.
“Johnny,” a horse owned by Captain Bowley, is employed by the
government during the winter season to assist in hauling the
apparatus to wrecks.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. GEORGE W. BOWLEY, KEEPER OF PAMET RIVER STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Capt. George W. Bowley, keeper of the Pamet River Life-Saving
Station, was born in Provincetown, Sept. 27, 1870, and has been in
the United States Life-Saving Service for eleven years, ten as a surfman
at the Highland Station at North Truro, and one year as keeper
of this station.</p>

<p>Captain Bowley came from a family of life savers, his father having
been a surfman at the High Head Station, in Provincetown, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
eighteen years, being forced to resign on account of ill-health caused
by the hardship he had suffered in that long term of service.</p>

<p>Captain Bowley when a boy was employed as a messenger at the
telegraph station in his native town. Later he went to sea on a
coasting vessel, and afterwards made a number of voyages to the
West Indies. He spent a number of years fishing along the shores
of Cape Cod, entering the service when he was twenty-one years of
age. The training as a life saver which he received at the Highland
Station, under the veteran keeper, Captain Worthen, not only made
him a No. 1 surfman, but also fitted him for the higher position which
he now holds.</p>

<p>Since he has been keeper of the Pamet River Station, Captain
Bowley has spared no pains to maintain a high standard of efficiency
and discipline, and he has a crew of trained surfmen ever ready to
obey his commands.</p>

<h3>PAMET RIVER STATION CREW.</h3>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SURFMAN E.&#160;S. DYER, PAMET RIVER STATION.</p>

<p>Oldest surfman in the United States Life-saving Service.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Ephraim S. Dyer. He was born in Truro in
1845, and has the distinction of being the oldest surfman in point of
years of service, among the life savers of Cape Cod, if not in the
United States. He joined
the service when it was established
on Cape Cod, and
has been attached to the
Pamet River Station ever
since that time. Before entering
the service Surfman
Dyer went to sea for a number
of years, following the
coastwise trade. He also
spent a number of years as
a fisherman and boatman
along the shores of Cape
Cod, and was in every way
qualified for the position he
has held for so long a time.
During his long term of service
Surfman Dyer has had
many narrow escapes from
death in the performance of
his duty. Upon one occasion
when three wrecks, the <i>Powwow</i>,
<i>Miles Standish</i>, and
<i>Pavey</i>, occurred at one time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
he became entangled in the wreckage of one of the vessels, and a big
rope, becoming twisted around his legs, dragged him to the bottom,
nearly drowning him. During the thirty years that he has been connected
with this station, Surfman Dyer has assisted at all the wrecks
that have occurred near there, and beyond a sprained ankle he has
never received any other injury in the work of saving life and property.
The hardships which he has suffered in thirty years do not
appear to have affected him in the least. He is hale and hearty and
ever ready to respond to the call “vessel ashore.”</p>

<p>Surfman Dyer was twice married; his present wife was formerly
Lydia Moore. He has one child, a daughter.</p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is Joseph H. Atwood. He was born in Weymouth,
Mass., in 1845, and has been in the life-saving service for
seventeen years, all of which have been spent at this station. Surfman
Atwood went to sea when he was but nine years of age.</p>

<p>For thirty-one years he followed the sea in one capacity or another,
making a number of voyages to the West Indies, in engaging in
the coastwise trade. From his long years of service on the water he
was especially adapted for the arduous duties of a surfman. He has
had many thrilling experiences as a surfman. Once he had his leg
fractured in assisting at a wreck, and later at the wreck of the schooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
<i>Campbell</i> he was hit on the head by a falling spar and nearly killed.
He was twice married; his present wife was formerly Mary Dyer. He
is the father of two daughters.</p>

<p>The No. 3 surfman is Richard Honey. He was born in Truro in
1862, and has been in the life-saving service for twelve years, all of
which have been at this station. Surfman Honey was a sailor before
entering the service. He was an expert boatman when a boy, and
after entering the service he quickly became familiar with the work
incident to a surfman’s life, and has made a faithful and fearless life
saver. He married Drusilla Gray.</p>

<p>The No. 4 surfman is George Paine. He was born in Truro, and is
forty-eight years of age. Surfman Paine has been in the life-saving
service and a member of the Pamet River crew for twelve years.
When a young man he went to sea on a coasting schooner. Later he
became a trap fisherman and was stationed at Sandwich and other
points along the bay shore for a number of years.</p>

<p>As a trap fisherman he was obliged to battle with the surf, and he
has few equals as a boatman.</p>

<p>He possessed the highest qualifications when he entered the service,
and has made a brave and trustworthy life saver. He married
Annie Allen, and is the father of five children, three girls and two
boys.</p>

<p>The No. 5 surfman is Isaiah T. Hatch. He was born in Truro in
1857. He first entered the life-saving service in 1888, remaining at
this station for one year. He reentered the service in 1892, and again

sailor boatman and fisherman from the time he was a young man
until he entered the service, and was familiar with the duties which
he has been called upon to perform as a life saver. He is a skilled
boatman and a brave and hardy son of Cape Cod, who knows no peril
when duty calls. He married Katie Rogers.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is Manuel Cory. He was born in Provincetown
in 1869, and has been in the life-saving service for seven years,
all of which have been spent at this station. Surfman Cory was a
boatman and fisherman before he entered the service. He is a perfect
type of a life saver. Of perfect physique and muscles of steel,
the rigors and perils of his vocation have no terrors for him. He is
skilled in boating and every branch of the work of life saving,
a surfman, who knows no fear when duty calls. He married
Mabel F. Snow.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is Alonzo Nickerson. He was born in Harwich
in 1871, and has been in the service five years. He was a boatman
and fisherman before entering the service, and has made a skilled and
faithful life-saver.</p>

<h3>ORLEANS STATION.</h3>

<p>This station is another of the original nine stations erected on the
shores of Cape Cod in 1872. It is located on what is called Little Ponchet
Island, back of the Nauset Beach, about two and one-half miles
south of Nauset Harbor, and about five miles from the Orleans village.
Its approximate position, as obtained from the latest coast survey
charts, is latitude north 41° 45′ 35″, longitude west 69° 56′ 00″.</p>

<p>The first keeper of the station was the late Captain Solomon Linnell,
who was succeeded by Capt. Marcus Pierce. Captain Pierce was keeper
of the station for fifteen years, and upon his retiring from the service,
Capt. James H. Charles was placed in command.</p>

<figure id="i102" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i102.jpg" width="1427" height="944" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">ORLEANS STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The station is located at one of the most dangerous sections of the
coast, sunken bars stretching along the coast there for miles. The
patrol north from this station extends as far as Nauset Harbor, two
and one-half miles, the surfmen using time clocks. The south patrol
covers two and one-half miles of beach, the surfmen meeting and
exchanging checks with the surfmen from the Old Harbor Station.
Before the Old Harbor Station was built, the surfmen from this station
were obliged to cover the entire beach south as far as Chatham Harbor,
a distance of five miles.</p>

<p>At this station there are three surf-boats, two beach carts with guns,
breeches-buoys, etc., and a torch light, the latter which gives a
tremendously powerful light and is of great benefit to the life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
savers while working at wrecks in the night. Captain Charles has a
horse at this station which the government employs during the winter
season.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">ALONG THE SHORE AT ORLEANS STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Since Captain Charles has been keeper of the Orleans Station nearly
one hundred lives have been saved by his crew from wrecked vessels.
From the schooner <i>Lizzie M. Center</i> sixteen men were taken ashore in
the surf-boat by his crew, the schooner being saved. From the steam
launch <i>Etta</i> ten men were taken ashore in the surf-boat. Two men
were rescued from a dory by the surf-boat, and from the schooner
<i>Ann</i> three men were saved by the surf-boat and the vessel floated.
From the schooner <i>Lottie L. Haskins</i> fourteen men were taken ashore
in the surf-boat and the vessel saved. Two men were taken ashore
from a cat-boat, but the life savers could not save the craft. From
the schooner <i>Walter Miller</i> the crew of five and one woman were
taken ashore in the breeches-buoy and the vessel saved. The
schooner <i>Iva Laffrinier</i>, with crew of five men, was boarded by the
life savers, who took the crew ashore, the vessel becoming a total loss.
From the steam launch <i>Zilpha</i> three men were saved, and from the
schooner <i>Zenobia</i> the crew of three men were rescued by the surf-boat,
and the latter craft saved. From the sloop <i>Carrol</i> three men
were taken ashore by the surf-boat and the craft saved. From the
cat-boat <i>Mary C</i> three men were taken ashore in surf-boat. One man
from a dory and one from a small cat-boat were also brought ashore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
in the surf-boat. From the schooner <i>John L. Parker</i>, which became a
total loss, the crew of six men were taken off by the breeches-buoy.
From the schooner <i>Elsie M. Smith</i>, which also became a total loss,
sixteen men were taken ashore by the breeches-buoy, while from the
steam launch <i>No Name</i> two men and a woman and child were taken
ashore in the surf-boat.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>While Captain Charles and his crew have made many daring
rescues both by surf-boat and breeches-buoy, the hardest and most
perilous tasks they have are going offshore to the assistance of distressed
vessels. These jobs mean long and hard pulls with the perils
multiplied, as after boarding the crafts they are often compelled to work
them into port. No matter how far offshore the distressed vessel may
be, once she is sighted with colors flying at half-mast, Captain Charles
and his crew are off to her assistance. Frequently it happens that the
vessels they board, after pulling in the teeth of a gale for hours, are in a
sinking condition and the crews exhausted. It is then a race for life
to port, and many times have the life savers felt the vessels which
they have started to take into port sinking under them, before they
had gotten under way.</p>

<p>Captain Charles and his crew have had many narrow escapes in
going to the assistance of distressed vessels, and have often suffered
untold hardship in the work, but that they are ever ready to battle
with the wind or wave is evidenced by the great number of heroic
rescues they have made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<h3>CAPT. JAMES H. CHARLES.</h3>

<p>Capt. James H. Charles, keeper of the Orleans Station, was born in

land. He remained in the West but a year, returning to Cape Cod,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
and again joining the fishing fleet. After several seasons with the
fishing fleet, he entered the life-saving service, being assigned to the
Orleans Station under Capt. Marcus Pierce. As a surfman, under
the veteran Captain Pierce, Captain Charles displayed exceptional ability
as a boatman and life saver. The training he received with Captain
Pierce soon fitted him for the position to which he was subsequently
promoted, keeper of the station, succeeding Captain Pierce. Since
he has had charge of the station, a high standard of efficiency has
always been maintained, and the daring rescues which the crew of
his station has performed testifies to their efficiency, fearlessness, and
skill. Captain Charles married Lizzie Hurd, and is the father of
three daughters and one son.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">NAUSET STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Nauset Life-Saving Station is another of the original nine United
States Life-Saving Stations which were built on Cape Cod in 1872.
It is situated on Nauset beach about two and one-half miles from
North Eastham depot and village. Its approximate position as
obtained from the latest coast survey charts is latitude north 41° 50′
40″, longitude west 69° 45′ 00″. When this station was built it was
placed on a site one thousand feet south of its present location, but
the shifting sands soon required its being moved inland to a more
secure location, the site it now occupies. The sea at this point is constantly
making great inroads into the beach, the banks having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
cut away for a distance of about one hundred and fifty feet since the
station was built.</p>

<p>The patrol north from this station is about four and one-half miles,
the surfmen meeting and exchanging checks with the surfmen from
Cahoon’s Hollow. The south patrol is three and one-eighth miles, the
surfmen that go on that patrol using time clocks to record their
performance of duty.</p>

<p>Nauset bars extend along the shore at this station, and many terrible
wrecks have taken place there. When the station was opened Capt.
Marcus M. Pierce was appointed keeper. Later he was transferred
to the Orleans Station, and Capt. Walter D. Knowles was placed in
charge. Keeper Knowles was succeeded by the present keeper Captain
Bearse. There are two surf-boats of the Monomoy model, two
beach carts with breeches-buoy, etc., and a life-car at this station.</p>

<p>“Brad,” a horse owned by Captain Bearse, is on duty at the station
during the winter season.</p>

<p>Captain Bearse and his crew of life savers have rescued seventeen
persons in their surf-boat and seventeen shipwrecked sailors in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
breeches-buoy since Captain Bearse has been keeper, while thirty-eight
persons were rescued from the surf by ropes and small boats.
Of the total number of vessels stranded on the bars near the station
eight schooners and one cat-boat were a total loss. Not a life has

</figcaption></figure>

<p>Capt. Alonzo N. Bearse, keeper of the Nauset Life-Saving Station,
was born on Monomoy Point in 1842, and has been in the life-saving service
for nineteen years, three years as a surfman and sixteen as keeper
of this station. Born on Monomoy Island, within sight of the dreaded
shoals off Monomoy, as a boy he became familiar with boats and boating,
and witnessed the scenes of disaster that occurred along the coast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
near his home. He quickly learned the art of handling boats in rough
water, and in launching and landing through the surf. He went to sea
at an early age, shipping on a coastwise schooner. Returning from sea
shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted in the 43d
Massachusetts Infantry, Company E, serving honorably with his company
for eleven months, his term of enlistment. During the time
that he was at the front he took part in the severe fighting at Kingston,
Whitehall, and Goldsboro. He escaped unhurt, however, and
returned to Cape Cod, and again went to sea. He had a wide and
varied experience as mariner, fisherman, and boatman, and was well
qualified for the work of a surfman when he joined the Nauset Station
crew, under Captain Knowles, whom he subsequently succeeded as
keeper.</p>

<p>Captain Bearse labors diligently to maintain a high standard of efficiency
among his crew, and is a careful and fearless warrior of the
sea. Numerous disasters have occurred within the precincts of the
Nauset Station since he has been in command, and many have been
averted, owing to the vigilance of his surfmen.</p>

<p>He was twice married, his present wife was Cordelia Ellis, and he
is the father of three children.</p>

  <img src="images/i113.jpg" width="1408" height="939" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">OLD HARBOR STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>This station is provided with two surf-boats, two beach carts with
guns, breeches-buoys, etc., and a life-car. One of the surf-boats, a
small one, is kept in a boathouse on the point of the beach, about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
half mile from the station, where it can be quickly brought into use
for rescue work in the harbor and bay. The other surf-boat, the
large one, for use in the open sea, is kept in the station. A horse
which the government hires during the winter season is kept in a barn
close to the station.</p>

<p>The surfmen from this station have a patrol north for a distance of
two and one-half miles, meeting and exchanging checks with the surfmen
from the Orleans Station. On the south patrol, which is about
a mile, the surfmen use a time clock to register their patrolling of the
beach at that point.</p>

<p>Capt. Hezekiah F. Doane, keeper of the Old Harbor Station, was
born in Chatham in 1846, and has been in the life-saving service for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
twenty-two years, thirteen as a surfman and nine as keeper. When
he entered the service he was assigned to the Chatham Station, where
he served as a surfman for thirteen years, being appointed keeper of
the station in 1893. Captain Doane remained keeper of the Chatham
Station for five years or until he was transferred to the Old Harbor
Station in 1898. He was a fisherman, yachtsman, and mariner before
he entered the life-saving service and was well prepared for the work
he has since been called upon to perform. As a surfman at the
Chatham Station he had much work in rescuing shipwrecked crews
and assisting distressed vessels, and his appointment as keeper of the
Chatham Station was meritorious reward for faithful and efficient service.
While keeper of the Chatham Station, Captain Doane and his
brave crew of life savers made many perilous trips out over the
shoals to distressed vessels, and effected daring rescues of imperiled
crews. Owing to the shallow water along the Chatham shores, nearly
all the work performed by Captain Doane was with the surf-boats,
the breeches-buoy having been used but twice since he has been in
the service. He married Pemah B. Pierce, and is the father of two
sons.</p>

<h3>OLD HARBOR STATION CREW.</h3>

late Captains Tuttle and Eldredge. As a boatman and fisherman
along the Chatham shore and a substitute life saver he acquired a
thorough knowledge of the art of handling boats in the surf under the
most trying conditions, and was well qualified for the duties he has to
perform as a life saver.</p>

<h3>CHATHAM STATION.</h3>

<p>The Chatham Station is another of the original nine stations erected
on Cape Cod in 1872, and is situated near where it was first located. Its
approximate position as obtained from the latest coast survey charts
is latitude north 41° 39′ 10″, longitude west 69° 57′ 10″, one and one-quarter
miles southwest of Chatham lights. A few years after the
station was established it was moved across the harbor to where the
Old Harbor Station now stands. It remained there a few years when
it was again moved back to its original site, where it is now located,
on the northern end of Monomoy, near the “cut through,” within
easy distance of Chatham village.</p>

<p>When this station was moved from the Old Harbor site it was
believed that a new station would be built there, but not until after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the wreck of the schooner <i>Calvin B. Orcutt</i> on Old Harbor bars was
the station erected. The first keeper of the station was Capt. Alpheus
Mayo; he was in turn succeeded by Capt. Nathaniel Gould, Capt.
Hezekiah Doane, and the present keeper, Capt. Herbert Eldredge.</p>

<p>The patrol, south from this station, is two and one-quarter miles;
the north patrol about two miles. Checks are exchanged with the
surfmen from the Monomoy Station on the south; on the north patrol
time clocks are used. The station is supplied with four surf-boats,
(Monomoy model), one dory, two beach carts with full sets of apparatus,
and one life-car. “Baby,” a horse employed by the government,
is kept at the station to assist in hauling the apparatus to
wrecks.</p>

<h3>WRECKS AT THE CHATHAM STATION.</h3>

<p>Since Keeper Eldredge has had charge of this station he has made
twenty-six trips to disabled or wrecked vessels in the station surf-boat.
On board the vessels assisted by Keeper Eldredge and his crew
there were seventy-four persons. Of this number eight were taken
ashore in the surf-boat. Six of these comprised the crew of the
schooner <i>Electa Bailey</i>, which was a total loss, one was from a crippled
cat-boat, and the other was a sick sailor taken ashore from a schooner.
Most of the work done by the crew of the Chatham Station was on
two and three masted schooners that became stranded on the Chatham
bars.</p>

<h3>MONOMOY STATION.</h3>

<p>The Monomoy Station is another of the original nine stations erected
on Cape Cod when the United States Life-Saving Service was extended
to these shores. It is located two and one-half miles north of Monomoy
Light. Its approximate position as obtained from the latest
coast survey charts is latitude north 41° 35′ 25″, longitude west 69° 59′
10″. When the station was manned, March 20, 1873, Capt. George W.
Baxter, of West Harwich, was placed in command. He resigned on
account of ill-health in 1882, and his successor was Capt. William
Tuttle. His death occurred July 1, 1899, and the late Capt. Marshall
W. Eldredge was appointed to fill the vacancy Aug. 4, 1899.
Captain Eldredge perished in an attempt to rescue five persons from
the stranded barge <i>Wadena</i>, March 17, 1902.</p>

<p>The patrol north of this station is about two and one-half miles, the
surfmen meeting and exchanging checks with the surfmen from the
Chatham Station. The patrol south is about one and one-half miles,
the surfmen meeting and exchanging checks with the surfmen from
the Monomoy Point Station.</p>

<p>There is no more dangerous stretch of coast on Cape Cod than off
Monomoy. Disaster follows disaster in that region, and the work of
the life savers is attended with the greatest peril at all times.</p>

<p>The following disasters have occurred at the Monomoy Station
since Captain Ellis has been in command: Schooner <i>Elwood Burton</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of New York, stranded on the Handkerchief Shoal, the life savers
rescuing her crew of six men in their surf-boat. Five men, the crew
of the barge <i>Paxinos</i>, which had struck on Pollock Rip, were rescued
from a sinking boat by the Monomoy crew. They were later placed
aboard the barge, which was soon floated by the life savers. From the
schooner <i>Dora Mathews</i>, which stranded on the beach near the station,
three men were taken ashore in the breeches-buoy. A number of other
crafts which met with disaster along the shore were assisted by Captain
Ellis and his crew.</p>

<h3>CAPT. SETH L. ELLIS.</h3>

<p>Capt. Seth L. Ellis, keeper of the Monomoy Station and sole survivor
of the Monomoy disaster, was born in Harwich Port, Oct. 12,
1858, and has been in the life-saving service seven years, all of which
have been at this station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>Captain Ellis came from a family of seafaring people. His father,
Capt. Seth N. Ellis, was an old West Indies tradesman.</p>

<p>Captain Ellis went to sea with his father when but nine years of age.
When fifteen years of age Captain Ellis joined the fleet of mackerel
fishermen, remaining with the fleet until he went coasting. While a
member of the crew of the three-masted schooner <i>Enos B. Phillips</i>, of
Boston, Capt. T. Reuben Allen, of Harwich Port, master, the vessel
was struck by a blizzard that made her a helpless wreck. With her
jibboom, bowsprit, foremast, and maintop masts gone, all her head
sails lost, and the cabin and forecastle wrecked, the schooner was
blown across the gulf stream and out of the track of all shipping.
After many days, during which the crew suffered terribly, Captain
Allen finally triumphed and brought the vessel into port.</p>

<p>Captain Ellis has been master of sailing and steam vessels, and now
carries a captain’s first-class steamboat license for the Atlantic coast.
Captain Ellis was also a well-known mackerel fisherman, being a
member of the crew of the first steam fishing vessel employed in
mackerel fishery, the <i>Novelty</i>, of Boston. Later Captain Ellis engaged
in boat fishing along the shores of the Cape near Chatham,
continuing in that work until he joined the Monomoy crew of life
savers.</p>

<h3>MONOMOY STATION CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Walter C. Bloomer. He was born in Chatham
in 1867, and has been in the life-saving service for five years. Surfman
Bloomer was a “Monomoy” fisherman, boatman, and wrecker before
entering the service. When he joined the service he was assigned to
the Brant Rock Station, where he remained three years, being transferred
to this station. At this station, under the late Captain
Eldredge, he saw much active service and proved himself a fearless
and skilful surfman. On the occasion of the terrible Monomoy
disaster, when his keeper and six of his comrades lost their lives,
Surfman Bloomer was doing cook duty, and remained at the station.
He married Velma Stevens, and is the father of two girls and two boys.</p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is Thomas H. Kane. He was born in Manchester,
N.&#160;H., in 1870, and has been in the life-saving service four
years. Surfman Kane followed the sea from the time he was fifteen
years of age until he entered the life-saving service. He was a
“grand banker,” a mackerel fisherman, and had a wide and varied
experience on the water. He was a member of the Rockport Life-Saving
crew, and was with Captain Charles at the Orleans Station for
one year. Surfman Kane joined the Monomoy Station, to fill a
vacancy caused by the death of one of the crew who perished with
Captain Eldredge at the Monomoy disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>He is an expert boatman, a brave and hardy surfman. He married
Sarah Whellock, and is the father of a daughter and son.</p>

<p>The No. 3 surfman is Edwin A. Studley. He was born in North
Harwich in 1864, and has been in the life-saving service for two
years, one year at the Orleans Station and one year at this station.
Surfman Studley followed the sea since he was a boy. For several
years he was a member of the crew of the Pollock Rip Lightship, and
later he joined the crew of the Shovelful Lightship. He was also a
sailor in the coastwise trade, and engaged in boating and fishing
along the Chatham shores for several years. He is an efficient boatman
and a fearless life saver. He married Alice Phillips, and is the
father of a son.</p>

<p>The No. 4 surfman is George C. Cahoon. He was born in Harwich
in 1872, and has been in the life-saving service but a year. When he
entered the service he was assigned to the Race Point Station, under
Capt. “Sam” Fisher, and was transferred here this year. Surfman
Cahoon was a fisherman and boatman along the shores of Cape Cod
from the time he was a boy until he entered the service. He is an
able boatman and has already shown himself to be an efficient life
saver. He married Emma Jones, and is the father of a daughter.</p>

<p>The No. 5 surfman is Walter F. Wixon. He was born in South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Chatham in 1866, and is serving his first year in the life-saving service.
Having been a boatman and fisherman along the shores “back
of the Cape” for a number of years, he is skilled in handling a boat,
and has a thorough knowledge of the rips and shoals that line the
shore there. He married Minnie E. Chase.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is Thomas W. Bearse. He was born in West
Harwich in 1863, and is serving his first season as a life saver. Surfman
Bearse was a boatman and fisherman along the Chatham shores
before he entered the service, and was well prepared for the work he
has been called upon to perform as a surfman. He married Annie
Cahoon, and is the father of two boys.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is Frank Thomas. He was born in Provincetown
in 1874, and entered the life-saving service Dec. 1, 1902. Surfman
Thomas went to the Grand Banks when he was but eleven years
of age. He followed the sea from that time until he entered the service,
engaging principally in dory fishing off Cape Cod. He is an
expert boatman and gives promise of becoming an able life saver.
He married Rosie Gracie, and is the father of two daughters.</p>

<p>The No. 8 surfman is Marcus N. Smith. He was born in West
Chatham in 1865, and has been in the life-saving service one year.
He followed the sea and was a boatman and fisherman along the
shores of Cape Cod from the time he was a boy until he joined the
service. He first served at the Muskeget Station, Nantucket, joining
this station as the winter man Dec. 1, 1902. He has proved his
efficiency as a life saver, and is a valuable addition to the crew at this
station.</p>

<p>Owing to the great amount of work which the crew of this station
was called upon to perform, and the long patrol that the surfmen
were obliged to go over before the Monomoy Point Station was built,
eight surfmen were employed at this station, and they are still
retained. It is the only station on Cape Cod where that number of
surfmen are employed.</p>

<h3>MONOMOY POINT STATION.</h3>

<p>The Monomoy Point Station is located near the extreme end of
Monomoy Island, about nine miles from Chatham lights, which bear
about north-northeast. Monomoy Island is a long, narrow strip of
beach at the elbow of Cape Cod. The dreaded Shovelful and Handkerchief
shoals stretch out under the waters of Nantucket Sound along
the eastern and southern shores of the island, and in the vicinity
countless vessels have met their doom and many lives have been lost.
Owing to the great number of disasters that occurred off the southern
end of Monomoy, the present life-saving station was built. At the
time that this station was erected it was intended that the old Monomoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
Station should be abandoned and the crew transferred to this
station.</p>

<p>After the appalling calamity, “The Monomoy Disaster” on March
17, 1902, when Captain Eldredge and six of his crew of life savers lost
their lives, the department decided to continue the old Monomoy
Station.</p>

<p>The station is one of the most modern buildings of its kind, with
large and airy rooms for the crew and a big boat room for the surf-boats,
beach carts, and other apparatus.</p>

<figure id="i127" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i127.jpg" width="1399" height="930" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">MONOMOY POINT STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The patrol north from this station is about one and one-half miles,
the surfmen meeting and exchanging checks with the surfmen from
the Old Monomoy Station. The south patrol along the beach on
the end of Monomoy is also about one and one-half miles, the
surfman on that patrol carrying a time clock to record their performance
of duty.</p>

<p>At the Monomoy Point Station there are three surf-boats. One of
these boats is a self-bailer, the only one on Cape Cod. There are also
two beach carts with apparatus, and one life-car. Six surfmen with
Keeper Kelley go in the self-bailer at the time of shipwreck. A horse
owned by the government, called “Susan,” is kept at the station to
assist in hauling the apparatus to scenes of disaster. There are also
two other horses owned by the surfmen kept there. Cats are the pets
of the surfmen, a half dozen making their home at the station.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">CAPT. JOSEPH C. KELLEY, KEEPER OF MONOMOY POINT STATION.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Capt. Joseph C. Kelley, keeper of the Monomoy Point Life-Saving
Station, was born in West Brewster in 1873, and has been in the life-saving
service for five years. When he entered the service he was
assigned to the Peaked Hill Bars Station under Captain Cook. He
remained there but a few months, when he was transferred to the
Chatham Station under Capt. Herbert Eldredge. Captain Kelley was
appointed keeper of the new Monomoy Point Station in August, 1902,
although the station was not manned until Oct. 30, 1902. Captain
Kelley has the distinction of being the youngest life-saving station
keeper on Cape Cod, if not in the United States, having been honored
with the appointment of keeper of the Monomoy Point Station when
he was but twenty-nine years of age.</p>

<p>When a young man he was a boatman and fisherman along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
shores of Cape Cod, and later became a coastwise sailor. He became
accustomed to the perils incident to the work of boating along the
shores of the Cape, and skilled in handling boats in the roughest water
at an early age. At the Peaked Hill Bars Station under the veteran
seafighter, Captain Cook, Surfman Captain Kelley received a most
thorough drilling in the work of life saving, which proved of untold
benefit to him when he joined the Chatham Station, and better prepared
him for the responsible position he now occupies. At the
Chatham Station under Captain Eldredge, Captain Kelley was No. 1
surfman. He assisted at all the wrecks that occurred along the shore
there for nearly five years, demonstrating his ability to cope with
the most stupendous problems of life saving. Captain Kelley has a
selected crew of experienced and fearless surfmen, who in the brief
history of the station have proven themselves equal to every emergency
that has arisen.</p>

<p>Five disasters occurred on the shoals near the station within as
many weeks after the station was manned, and in every case the
vessels were saved and not a life was lost. Captain Kelley married
Chestena Batchelder.</p>

<h3>MONOMOY POINT STATION CREW.</h3>

<p>The No. 1 surfman is Joseph D. Bloomer. He was born in Prince
Edward Island in 1857, and has been in the life-saving service since
Oct. 1, 1902. Surfman Bloomer followed the sea in one capacity or
another since he was a boy. For five years he was engaged in trading
between Portland and the West Indies Islands. Upon coming to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Cape Cod he took up his residence in Chatham, and for the past
twenty-five years he has been a boatman, fisherman, anchor dragger,
and wrecker on the shoals off Monomoy. Before entering the life-saving
service as a regular surfman, he had substituted at the Chatham
and Monomoy Stations, and was well used to the duties of a surfman.
The rips and shoals off Monomoy are all familiar to Surfman Bloomer.
During the twenty-five years that he has spent in that region he assisted
at all the wrecks that took place near there, and was one of the
best-known Monomoy wreckers so-called. Skilled in the art of boating,
with a thorough knowledge of the shoals along the shores of Cape
Cod, Surfman Bloomer has few equals as a life saver. He married
Adeline Bloomer.</p>

<p>The No. 2 surfman is John E. Ellis. He was born in West Harwich
in 1874, and entered the life-saving service when this station was
manned Oct. 1, 1902. Surfman Ellis followed the sea from the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
that he was a boy until he joined the life-saving service. He engaged
in steamboating for a few years, and later made a great number of
trips on barges from the middle Atlantic ports around Cape Cod. He
spent several years boating and fishing on the shoals off Monomoy,
and is a skilled boatman and a fearless life saver. He married Lilian
M. Ashley.</p>

<p>The No. 3 surfman is Obed H. Shiverick. He was born in Dennis
in 1867, and entered the life-saving service when this station was
manned.</p>

<p>Surfman Shiverick went to sea when a small boy, his first trip being
to the Grand Banks. He was a fisherman for a number of years, when
he joined the crew of the Cross Rip Lightship under Captain Jorgensen,
and for four years was a member of the Nantucket Shoals Lightship,
also under Captain Jorgensen, going with the veteran captain
when he took charge of that floating beacon. Surfman Shiverick has
had a wide and varied experience on the water. He is familiar with
the rips and shoals along the shores of Cape Cod, is a skilled boatman,
and a brave and efficient life saver. He married Sadie McQuarrie,
and is the father of two daughters.</p>

<p>The No. 4 surfman is Edwin L. Clark. He was born in Chatham
in 1876, and has been in the life-saving service since Oct. 1, 1902.
Surfman Clark followed the sea from a boy. For a number of years
he engaged in barge towing around Cape Cod, and later joined the
crew of the Shovelful Lightship, where he remained one year. At
different periods for two years he substituted at the Monomoy Station,
under the late Captain Eldredge. He is well accustomed to the hardships
incident to a surfman’s life, skilled in the art of handling boats,
and is an able life saver. He married Minnie B. West, and is the
father of a daughter.</p>

<p>The No. 5 surfman is Reuben W. Eldredge. He was born in South
Dennis in 1864, and entered the life-saving service when this station
was manned. Surfman Eldredge followed the sea from a boy. For
ten successive years he went cod-fishing to the Grand Banks. While
fishing on the banks one season he lost track of his vessel during a
thick fog, and was tossed about in an open dory for five days without
food or water. He was finally picked up in an unconscious condition
by a French fishing vessel, and put aboard his own vessel. He recovered
in a short time, and despite the terrible suffering through
which he passed, continued to go to the “banks” for several years.
Later he became a coastwise sailor, and was also a member of the
crew of the steamer <i>City of Macon</i> for some time.</p>

<p>Surfman Eldredge, after giving up going to sea, became a fisherman
and wrecker along the shores of Monomoy. He also substituted at
the Chatham Station under the late Captain Eldredge. He is perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
at home in a boat under any and all conditions of wind or
weather. The sea has no terrors for him, and he is inured to the
hardships and perils of a life saver’s life. He married Alice D.
Young, and is the father of a son.</p>

<p>The No. 6 surfman is Joseph Christie. He was born in Scotland,
is thirty-one years of age, and has been in the life-saving service since
this station was manned. Surfman Christie was a boatman and fisherman
for a number of years, and also served as substitute at the Cuttyhunk
Life-Saving Station. He served in the United States Navy in
the war with Spain. He married Lizzie Jackson. Surfman Christie
is at present on sick leave, on account of injuries received in the
performance of his duty.</p>

<p>The No. 7 surfman is John E. Ryder. He was born in Chatham in
1879, and has been in the life-saving service two years. He is the
winter man, so called. During the summer season Surfman Ryder is
stationed at the City Point Station, South Boston. Before entering
the service he was a boatman and fisherman along the coast of Cape
Cod, becoming familiar with the handling of boats in the surf, and
acquiring a knowledge of the rips and shoals that abound there. He
is an expert boatman and a brave and hardy life saver.</p>

<p>Surfman Charles G. Hamilton, who is substituting for Surfman
Christie, joined the crew on Dec. 1, 1902. He was born in Chatham
in 1859. He has been a boatman, lobsterman, fisherman, and wrecker
off Monomoy for nearly twenty years. For the past fifteen years he
has lived on Monomoy Point, and has assisted at nearly all the
wrecks that have occurred in that vicinity during that time. He is a
well-known wrecker, who knows the location of every rip and shoal in
the region about Monomoy.</p>

<p>He was also a grand banker, a coastwise sailor, and engaged in
steamboating around the Cape. He is thoroughly accustomed to the
perils of the sea, and is an expert boatman and a fearless life saver.
He married Etta Batchelder.</p>

<h3>THE MONOMOY DISASTER.</h3>

<p>When the late Capt. Marshall W. Eldredge was appointed
keeper, Captain Ellis was his No. 1 surfman. Captain Ellis served
as No. 1 surfman until May 1, 1902, when he was appointed
keeper to succeed his late captain, whose life was given up in an
heroic attempt to rescue an imperiled crew. Captain Ellis married
Aureilla M. Cahoon, and is the father of one son. The story of the
terrible tragedy in which Captain Eldredge and six members of his
crew, together with five persons whom they had taken from the
stranded barge <i>Wadena</i>, perished, is best told by the sole survivor,
Captain Ellis, and is as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>“On Tuesday, March 11, 1902, about one o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&#160;M.</span> the schooner
barge <i>Wadena</i> stranded during a northeast gale and heavy sea on the
Shovelful Shoal, off the southern end of Monomoy Island. The crew
were rescued by our station crew. The barge remained on the shoal
without showing any signs of going to pieces, and wreckers were engaged
in lightering her cargo of coal. On the night of March 16 the
weather became threatening, and all except five of the persons
engaged in lightering the cargo were taken ashore from the barge by
the tug <i>Peter Smith</i>, which was in the employ of the owners of the
barge.</p>

<p>“Shortly before eight o’clock on the morning of March 17 one of
the patrolmen from our station reported that the <i>Wadena</i> appeared to
be in no immediate danger, but later Captain Eldredge received a
message from Hyannis, inquiring whether everything was all right
with the men aboard the barge. Up to this time no one at the
station was aware that any persons had remained on the barge over
night.</p>

<figure id="i133" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i133.jpg" width="1348" height="886" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BARGES WADENA AND FITZPATRICK STRANDED ON SHOALS AT MONOMOY.</p>

<p><i>Wadena</i> in foreground. In attempting to take an imperiled crew off the <i>Wadena</i>, Captain Eldredge
and six of his crew of life savers perished, together with the crew of the barge, five in number. March
17, 1902.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“Upon the receipt of this inquiry Captain Eldredge, putting on his
hip boots and oil clothes, set out for the end of the Point, where he
could personally ascertain the conditions.</p>

<p>“Arriving there he found that the barge was flying a signal of distress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
He at once telephoned me, as I was the No. 1 man at the
station, directing me to launch the surf-boat from the inside of the
beach, and with the crew pull down to the Point. About two and one-half
miles south of the station we took Captain Eldredge aboard and
I gave him the steering oar.</p>

<p>“The wind was fresh from the southeast and there was a heavy sea
running, but all the crew were of the opinion that the condition of the
barge <i>Wadena</i> was not perilous, as she seemed to be sound and lying
easy.</p>

<p>“Captain Eldredge decided to pull around the Point to the barge. At
certain places on the shoals the sea was especially rough, and some
water was shipped on the way out to the distressed craft, but without
any trouble we succeeded in bringing our surf-boat under the lee of
the barge just abaft the forerigging, the only place where it was practical
to go alongside.</p>

<figure id="i134" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i134.jpg" width="1278" height="907" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption">DRILL OF THE MONOMOY CREW, SHORTLY BEFORE THE DISASTER
IN WHICH SEVEN OF THE CREW PERISHED.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“As soon as we got alongside the barge a line was thrown aboard and
quickly made fast by the persons on board. The persons on board
the barge were all excited and wanted us to take them ashore as soon
as we could. Captain Eldredge, without a moment’s delay, when he
found out the number of persons on board the barge and their desire
to be taken ashore, directed them to get into the surf-boat.</p>

<p>“The seas were breaking heavily around the stern of the barge, and
there was little room for operations in the smooth water, and the rail
of the barge was twelve or thirteen feet above the surf-boat. Four of
the five men lowered themselves over the side of the barge, one at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
time, into the surf-boat, without mishap, by means of a rope, but the
captain of the barge, who was a big, heavy man, let go his hold when
part way down and dropped into the boat with such force as to break
the after thwart. All five being safely in the boat, two were placed
forward, two aft, and one amidships, and told to sit quietly and keep
close down in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>“In order to get away from the barge quickly, the painter was cut,
by orders of Captain Eldredge, and the surf-boat was at once shoved
off. In order to clear the line of breakers that extended from the
stern of the barge so that we could lay a good course for the shore,
a part of the surfmen were backing hard on the port oars, while the
others gave way with full power on the starboard side. Before we
could get the boat turned around a big wave struck us with fearful
force, and quite a lot of water poured into the surf-boat.</p>

<p>“Captain Eldredge stood in the stern of the boat with the steering
oar in his hand giving his orders, and the surfmen stuck to their posts.</p>

<p>“As soon as the water came into the boat, the rescued men jumped
up, and becoming panic-stricken, threw their arms about the necks of
the surfmen so that none of us could use our oars. The seas, one
after another, struck us, and the boat, filling with water, turned
bottom up, throwing us all into the raging sea. The seas kept striking
us after the boat upset, and we were soon in among the heaviest
breakers. Twice we righted the boat, but the seas which struck her
before we could get into her capsized her each time.</p>

<p>“After righting the boat twice, our strength was fast leaving us,
and we all knew that we could not survive long without assistance.
The five men that we had taken off the barge were the first to be
swept off the overturned boat and to perish before our eyes. They
did not regain a hold of the boat after she turned over the first time,
and were quickly swept to death.</p>

<p>“All of us clung to the boat, giving each other all the encouragement
that we could. Surfman Chase was the first one of our crew
to perish, then Nickerson and Small were swept to death. Captain
Eldredge, Surfmen Kendrick, Foye and Rogers and myself still
managed to hold to the boat. Every sea which struck the boat
swept completely over us, almost smothering us. Kendrick was the
next one of our crew to perish, and poor Foye soon followed him.
Captain Eldredge and Surfman Rogers and myself were the only ones
left, and we expected that we, too, would soon share the fate of our
comrades.</p>

<p>“Rogers was clinging to the boat about amidships, while Captain
Eldredge and myself were holding on near the stern. Captain
Eldredge called to me to help him to get a better hold, and I managed
to pull him on to the bottom of the boat, when a sea struck us and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
washed us both off. I managed to regain a hold on the bottom of the
boat, and looking around for Captain Eldredge, I saw that he was
holding on to the spar and sail which had drifted from underneath the
boat, but was still fast to it. The seas were washing me off the boat
continually at this time, and when I last saw our brave captain, he was
drifting away from the boat, holding on to the spar and sail.</p>

<p>“My strength was fast going, and when poor Rogers begged me to
help him climb further up onto the boat, the only thing I could do
was to tell him that we were drifting towards the beach, and that help
would soon be at hand and to hold on.</p>

<figure id="i136" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">CHURCH AT ORLEANS WHERE MEMORIAL SERVICES WERE HELD FOR LOST MONOMOY CREW.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“Rogers had lost his strength, however, and failing to get a more
secure place on the bottom of the boat, feebly moaning, ‘I have got
to go,’ he fell off the boat and sank beneath the waters.</p>

<p>“I was now alone on the bottom of the boat, and seeing that the center
board had slipped part way out, I managed to get hold of it, and
holding it with one hand succeeded in getting my oil clothes, undercoat,
vest, and boots off.</p>

<p>“By that time the overturned boat had drifted down over the shoals
in the direction of the barge <i>Fitzpatrick</i>, which was also stranded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
on the shoals, and when I sighted the craft I waved my hand as a
signal for help. I soon saw those on the barge fling a dory over the
side into the water, but could see nothing more of the dory after that
on account of the mist and high sea until it hove in sight with a man
in it rowing towards me. The man in the dory was brave Capt.
Elmer F. Mayo. He ran the dory alongside of me, and with his help
I got into the boat. I was so used up that I was speechless, and all
that I could do was to kneel in the bottom of the boat and hold on to
the thwarts. To land in the dory through the surf was a perilous
undertaking, but Mayo, who is a skilled boatman, carefully picked his
way over the rips and headed his little boat for the shore.</p>

<p>“Surfman Bloomer of our station, who had been left ashore, had
walked down to the Point to assist Captain Eldredge and crew in landing,
and when he saw Mayo fighting his way through the breakers, he
ran down into the surf, seized the little boat, and helped Mayo to land
safely.</p>

<p class="clear">“Bloomer was told of the terrible tragedy by Captain Mayo, as I was
unable to speak at the time. As I have often said, ‘If the persons
we took off the barge had kept quiet as we told them to, all hands
would have been landed in safety.’”</p>

<h3 class="clear">CAPT. ELMER F. MAYO.</h3>

<p>Capt. Elmer F. Mayo, “The Hero of Monomoy,” was born in
Chatham, and is forty years of age. From boyhood he has been a boatman,
fisherman, anchor dragger, a substitute at the life-saving stations
on Cape Cod, and wrecker along the shores near Monomoy, and
is well accustomed to the perils and rigors incident to work of that kind.</p>

<p>Among the boatmen and wreckers along the Chatham and Monomoy
shores he has always been regarded as an A No. 1 boatman,
skilled in the art and science of handling boats in the surf, and absolutely
fearless. His father was the first keeper of the Chatham Station.</p>

<p>Upon the discovery of gold in the Klondike region a few years ago,
Mayo joined a party of prospectors, and went to the Copper River
country. He remained there but a short time, returning to Cape Cod
and resuming his former occupation.</p>

<p>At the time of the Monomoy disaster, he was on board the barge
<i>Fitzpatrick</i>, near by the stranded barge <i>Wadena</i>, in company with
Captain Mallows of Chatham, and the captain of the barge.</p>

<p>The <i>Fitzpatrick</i> had stranded at the time the <i>Wadena</i> went on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
shoals, and Mayo and Mallows were aboard arranging to float the craft.
They had remained on board the <i>Fitzpatrick</i> over night, the same as
those on board the <i>Wadena</i>, so as to be on hand early in the morning
to begin the work.</p>

<p>There was a small fourteen-foot dory alongside the <i>Fitzpatrick</i>, and
the night before the fatal disaster, the wind freshening up, Mayo
hauled the dory aboard, made some thole pins, and got a pair of oars
ready for use should bad weather oblige them to go ashore.</p>

SURFMAN ELLIS, WHOM HE RESCUED.</p>

<p>Captain Mayo standing.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The oars were too long for the small craft, and Mayo cut a piece off
each of them. The wind blew a gale during the night preceding the
disaster, and there was considerable rough water around the barge the
next morning. The craft was not leaking, however, and there seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
no cause for alarm. A thick fog swept in over the shoals in the morning,
hiding the stranded sister barge <i>Wadena</i> from the view of those
on the <i>Fitzpatrick</i>, and they were in ignorance of the fact that a signal
of distress was flying in her rigging.</p>

<p>The first intimation that Mayo and Mallows had that a terrible tragedy
had been enacted within a short distance of them was when the
overturned life-boat, with the sole survivor of the Monomoy life-saving
crew, Surfman Ellis, clinging to it, was seen drifting out over the
shoals.</p>

<p>At the sight of the life-boat with a surfman clinging to it, both
Mayo and Mallows knew that a terrible disaster had happened. Mayo
in an instant threw off all his clothing except his underclothes, and
while Mallows entreated him not to go, telling him he believed that to
attempt to reach the overturned life-boat would cost him his life,
Mayo grabbed the dory, threw it into the raging sea, and slid down a
rope from the barge into the frail craft.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">FOURTEEN-FOOT DORY USED BY CAPT. ELMER F. MAYO, IN RESCUING SURFMAN ELLIS.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>With the improvised thole pins and the long oars, with handles so
large that he could hardly grasp them, Mayo had a fearful struggle in
preventing the dory from being swamped by the seas.</p>

<p>With a strong and steady stroke, and energy born of desperation,
he kept the little boat head to the sea, sending her along with marvelous
speed. Within a short time he was within hailing distance of the
man on the bottom of the life-boat. Surfman Ellis saw the boat as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
was thrown from the barge, but in the fog had lost sight of it. Mayo,
however, had kept the overturned life-boat within sight all the time,
and as soon as he got within hailing distance he shouted to Ellis,
whom he then recognized, to hold on!</p>

<p>It was a hazardous task to take Ellis from the bottom of the life-boat,
but both Mayo and Ellis were skilled in that kind of work, and
it was successfully accomplished. To land on the beach through the
surf would be attended with greater peril, but Mayo knew that Ellis
must have immediate treatment, and after placing him in the bottom
of the boat, he headed the dory straight for the shore. The fog still
hung over the waters, and it was solely from his thorough knowledge
of the waters about that region that Mayo was able to avoid the
myriads of shoals and rips, and guide the boat to a point on the beach
where it would be possible to land. Surfman Bloomer, of the Monomoy
Station, who had walked down the beach, saw the boat headed
for the beach, and running down, got there just in time to assist Mayo
in landing.</p>

<p>Both the United States Government and the Massachusetts Humane
Society recognized this great heroic act of Captain Mayo, and awarded
him medals. The committee having charge of the Monomoy Fund also
presented him with a portion of the money received by them, in recognition
of his heroism in rescuing Surfman Ellis from a watery grave.</p>

<p>Captain Mayo married Mrs. Priscilla Nye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>The late Capt. Isaac Green Fisher, keeper of the Wood End Station,
was born in Truro in 1838, and was the son of Caleb and Mary G.
Fisher, of that town. For twenty years he was keeper of the Peaked
Hill Bars and Wood End Life-Saving stations, and was known the
country over as a wondrous surf-fighter and saver of human life.
Prior to his entering the life-saving service he had been engaged in
whaling for a number of years, and won distinction in that skilled work
by his fearlessness and marvelous dexterity with the steering oar.</p>

<p>As keeper of the dangerous Peaked Hill Bars Station, Captain Fisher
rescued hundreds of shipwrecked seafarers, and assisted a countless
number of stranded crafts to places of safety. He also assisted at
nearly all the wrecks that took place at the stations along the back of
the Cape, adjoining the Peaked Hill Bars Station.</p>

<p>He was retired from the service at his own request on account of
physical disability, June 14, 1901, and died September 18 following.</p>
